        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, it's amazing how music can have such a powerful impact. Is there a particular artist or band that you've been listening to on repeat recently?",

            "client_message": "Yes, I do. It was created in 2020 and is stored at my family lawyer's office."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Excellent, and do you have a power of attorney set up?",
            "client_message": "I do, actually. The power of attorney is granted to my spouse, Emily Underwood."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's nice to have stability, isn't it? Speaking of routines, do you incorporate any specific fitness activities into your schedule?",
            "client_message": "Actually, yes! I enjoy a mix of things. I run a few times a week and do yoga on weekends. How about you?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I try to keep active as well. I gravitate towards swimming and a little bit of cycling.",
            "client_message": "Those sound great! Swimming must be refreshing. I've considered adding it to my routine."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It really is. Plus, it's easy on the joints compared to running. Yoga must be relaxing for you, right?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, it helps me unwind and stretch things out. It's like a reset button, really."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a great way to put it. It's always good to find what works best for you.",
            "client_message": "Exactly, finding balance can make a big difference in overall well-being."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "For sure. Speaking of well-being, are there any other aspects of your lifestyle you've been focusing on recently?",
            "client_message": "Well, I’ve been trying to improve my sleep schedule. Getting consistent rest makes everything else easier."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Could you tell me a little more about your current living situation, James?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Helen! I currently own my place. It’s number 22, Farringdon Road, in London. Moved in back in June of 2018."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds lovely. So, you’ve been there for a while now. What made you decide to buy there?",
            "client_message": "I really liked the area. It’s vibrant and close to my work. Plus, owning felt like a smarter move back in 2018."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It must be nice to be settled. How does this compare to your previous place?",
            "client_message": "Oh, my previous spot was a bit different. It was a rented flat at 34B, Soho Square, also in London. I moved there in March 2020, right before the pandemic hit."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That must have been quite the experience. Why did you choose to move from Soho?",
            "client_message": "I liked Soho, but the rent was becoming a bit much. Owning in Farringdon has been more stable financially. Plus, I've always wanted to put down roots."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. It's great to see you making strategic moves like owning your home now. Were there any challenges you faced with the move?",
            "client_message": "Honestly, just the usual stress and a bit of a bad experience with the letting agent at my rented place. But nothing I couldn't handle."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, sometimes the stress of moving can be alleviated by some lighter moments. Pets can be great for that. Do you have any pets, James?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I do! I have a cat named Whiskers. You'd never believe how he reacts during the move. Such a character!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Really? Cats have the most interesting quirks. What does Whiskers get up to?",
            "client_message": "Oh, he loves to hide in the most unusual places, especially in boxes. When I was packing, he kept jumping into every open box. Made it hard to get things done but always brought a smile!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's adorable! They're like little comedians, aren't they? Pets just have this way of making things a bit more fun.",
            "client_message": "Definitely. And it's like they're in on some joke only they understand. He's always unpredictable but in the best way."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Next, I'd like to explore any dependents you may have, James. This is significant for your financial planning, so let's start there.",
            "client_message": "Of course, I have one daughter. Her name is Olivia Underwood."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and how old is Olivia?",
            "client_message": "Olivia was born on June 15th, 2015, so she's 8 now. Time flies!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, that gives us a clear timeline. We can consider her as your dependent until she turns 18. So, that would be until June 15th, 2033, correct?",
            "client_message": "Exactly, that sounds right. It's good to know we're looking that far ahead."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely. Planning for her future, whether it be education expenses or beyond, can really help set things up nicely.",
            "client_message": "Yeah, it's something I've been thinking about more and more."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm glad to hear that, James. Keeping Olivia's future secure is a wonderful step. Let's look at some options next.",
            "client_message": "That sounds great, Helen. Thanks for guiding me through this."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, there's nothing quite like starting the planning session with a warm cup of coffee or tea. Do you have a preference, James?",
            "client_message": "Oh, I enjoy both to be honest. It really depends on the mood or the weather."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I completely get that. Sometimes a strong coffee to kickstart the day or a soothing tea in the afternoon makes all the difference.",
            "client_message": "Exactly! On cold days, a good cup of tea feels comforting."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, and on those busy days, a coffee can really keep you going.",
            "client_message": "For sure. It's all about balance, just like with finances, right?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Now, regarding your monthly expenses, James, could you walk me through what takes priority for you?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Helen. One of my main priorities is my monthly rent. It’s $1,200, and that's a non-negotiable part of my budget every month."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I see, so your rent is $1,200 each month. That sounds like an essential fixed cost. Have you had a chance to think about any timelines or changes you might anticipate regarding this expense?",
            "client_message": "Not really a timeframe for change at the moment. It's pretty stable since I'm happy with my current place."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great to hear that stability. Keeping such a significant expense predictable is always beneficial. Beyond rent being essential, how do you feel about balancing it with other financial priorities?",
            "client_message": "It's definitely at the top, so I try to organize the rest around it. But I'm also interested in finding ways to save or invest without compromising my essentials."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "We can definitely explore some strategies to build savings or investments while ensuring your rent remains covered. Anything specific you’d like to aim for financially in the near future?",
            "client_message": "I'd love to start investing more, maybe in stocks or funds, but I’m also thinking about saving for a travel fund. Balancing those goals with my rent is key."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's exciting, James. We can tailor a plan that fits your saving and investing aspirations while ensuring your essential expenses like rent are always prioritized. Let’s map out some steps together.",
            "client_message": "Sounds perfect, Helen. I'm eager to get started on this journey with your guidance."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "How are you managing your mornings these days? Do you find enough time to rest with your current work schedule?",
            "client_message": "I try to get up early to make sure I have a good start to the day. Balancing work and a decent sleep schedule can be tricky, though."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I can imagine. Having a consistent morning routine can really set the tone for the day. Do you manage to squeeze in some breakfast or maybe a bit of exercise?",
            "client_message": "Usually, it's just a quick breakfast. Coffee is a must for me before diving into work!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Coffee is a lifesaver! It sounds like you've got a routine that works for you.",
            "client_message": "Yeah, it keeps me energized and ready to tackle the day's tasks."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'd like to hear your thoughts on your current freelance consulting income. How is everything going with that, James?",
            "client_message": "It's going pretty well, thanks! I'm bringing in about $5,000 every month from it."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear! Is that $5,000 amount pre-tax, or is it the net income you're taking home each month?",
            "client_message": "Oh, that's the net amount. I try to keep things simple and clear for myself."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. And is this consulting work something you're planning to continue for the foreseeable future, or do you see any changes coming up on the horizon?",
            "client_message": "I'm planning to keep it going for the long term. It's working well, and I enjoy the flexibility it gives me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's fantastic to have that flexibility. Could you clarify the frequency of this income? I assume it's monthly, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly. Every month, like clockwork."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, that gives us a solid foundation to work with. If you have any questions about how to manage or invest this income, just let me know.",
            "client_message": "Thanks, Helen! I might have a few questions soon, especially about saving and investing wisely."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of planning, have you had a chance to catch any games recently? It's a nice way to unwind after a busy week, isn't it?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, I try to tune in when I can. It's always exciting to follow along and see how our local team is doing."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I know what you mean! There's always something thrilling about it. Are you looking forward to any upcoming matches?",
            "client_message": "Definitely! It gives me something to look forward to over the weekend."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's great to have those moments to relax and enjoy. Now, shifting back to your finances, let's discuss your mortgage details a bit more.",
            "client_message": "Sure, Helen. I have it with GreenFields Bank."

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That special rate sounds beneficial. When is your final payment scheduled?",
