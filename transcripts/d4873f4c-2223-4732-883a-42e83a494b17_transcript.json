            "advisor_message": "It's always a good idea to keep things organized, especially when it comes to important documents and household items. It makes it so much easier when you need to find something quickly. How do you manage your household organization? Any particular system you use?",
            "client_message": "I try to keep things organized as much as possible. I'm a fan of labeling containers and keeping similar items together. It really helps to reduce clutter."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, having a system in place can make all the difference. It might also be helpful to do a little decluttering every season. It keeps everything fresh and you only hold onto the things you really need.",
            "client_message": "That's a great tip. I usually go through my stuff at least twice a year and donate anything I haven't used."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a wonderful practice. It not only helps to keep your space tidy but also benefits others who might need those items. Now, moving on to our next topic...",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Next, I'd like to explore your current and previous addresses, Daniel. This helps us understand your financial commitments and any potential changes affecting your planning.",
            "client_message": "Sure, that makes sense. What do you need to know?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's start with your current address. Could you confirm the details for me? I have here that you own your home at 22 Maple Street in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles County.",
            "client_message": "That's correct. I moved in on June 15, 2019."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and just to verify, this is in the 90210 postcode area, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right. It's 90210."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, thank you. Now, regarding your previous address, I understand you rented at 45B Avenue B in New York City. Is that correct?",

        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, thinking about the East Village reminds me of my time living in New York. There was this little bakery around the corner where I used to get these amazing bagels every Sunday.",
            "client_message": "That sounds wonderful! It's those little things that really make a place feel like home."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly! It's funny how a simple routine like that sticks with you over the years.",
            "client_message": "I know, right? I used to have a favorite coffee shop near my old place too. It really added a special touch to my mornings."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's amazing how those little routines create lasting memories. They become such a part of who you are.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, they do. All those small details feel so significant over time."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's talk about your dependents, Daniel. You mentioned Alice earlier; could you remind me of her full name and birthdate?",
            "client_message": "Of course, her full name is Alice Foster, and she was born on April 15th, 2012."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, thank you for that. With her birthdate, she’ll be a dependent until at least April 15th, 2030. Is that correct, from your understanding?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right. I want to make sure she's covered until she finishes her education."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, we’ll plan with that in mind. As she grows, her needs will certainly change. What are your priorities for her financial support right now?",
            "client_message": "I’m focusing mainly on her education. I want to ensure she has everything she needs, both now and for her future schooling."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s a wise approach. Have you considered any education savings plans, or are you looking for guidance on that?",
            "client_message": "I have thought about it, but I’d definitely appreciate your guidance to make sure I’m choosing the right option."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Of course, Daniel. I’ll make sure to outline some options that align with your future goals for Alice. We’ll keep her long-term education and well-being front and center.",
            "client_message": "Thank you, Alexa. That really eases my mind."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Have you been trying any new workouts lately, Daniel? I find different routines can really help clear the mind and keep everything balanced.",
            "client_message": "I have, actually! I started incorporating some yoga sessions into my week. It's been a great way to unwind."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds fantastic. Yoga can really help with stress and flexibility. Have you noticed any changes since you started?",
            "client_message": "Definitely, I feel more relaxed and it's a nice break from my usual running routine."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Mixing it up is always a good idea. Running and yoga make a great combo for both endurance and mindfulness.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, having variety keeps things interesting. It's similar to budgeting, really; balancing and keeping an eye on different areas to stay healthy overall.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "What about your current housing expenses, Daniel? I believe you mentioned rent previously.",
            "client_message": "Yes, rent is one of my main expenses. It's $1,500 a month."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Alright, so rent is an essential, recurring monthly expense. Do you feel comfortable with this amount fitting into your budget?",
            "client_message": "It's a bit on the high side, honestly, but it's manageable. I consider it necessary for now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Since it's an essential priority, it's important we build your budget around it. Is there anything specific about the rent or lease that you have concerns about?",
            "client_message": "Nothing specific with the lease. I just sometimes wonder if there's a way to optimize my other spending to better accommodate it."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, we can look at your full budget and identify areas for improvement. We'll make sure your essential expenses like rent are well-supported.",
            "client_message": "That would be great. I sometimes just need a bit of guidance to reassure me I'm on the right path."
        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Interesting! Do you have a favorite author or a genre that you always go back to?",
            "client_message": "I tend to gravitate towards historical fiction. The depth of the stories is fascinating, and Ken Follett is one of my favorites. His writing style really captivates me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Ken Follett is amazing! His ability to weave intricate narratives is truly impressive. I've always appreciated authors who can immerse readers so fully in another time and place.",
            "client_message": "Exactly! It’s like you’re living in that era. It’s such a nice break from the everyday routine."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Could you tell me a little more about your different income sources, Daniel, and how they're structured?",
            "client_message": "Sure, I have two main sources of income right now. First, there’s my freelance design work."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Freelance design sounds interesting! How much do you earn from that, and how often?",
            "client_message": "I make about $5,000 net monthly from it. It's ongoing, so it’s pretty consistent."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great! And you mentioned another source of income?",
            "client_message": "Yes, there's also rental property income. I get $12,000 quarterly from that."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Okay, and is that amount net or gross?",
            "client_message": "That's the gross amount. I'm planning to continue with this income stream until 2025."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Freelance design is monthly and net, while your rental property brings in gross income quarterly until 2025. This gives us a clear view of your current financial landscape. Let's build on this!",
            "client_message": "Sounds good, Alexa. I feel more informed already!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, Daniel, while we're on the topic of your financial plans, I must admit I had one of those mornings. I lost my favorite pen somewhere in the office, and I swear I had it just a moment before our meeting.",
            "client_message": "Oh no! I know that feeling all too well. It's amazing how something so small can disrupt your day. I once spent hours looking for my keys, only to find them in the most obvious place."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Isn't that always the case? It's like they grow legs and walk away! Anyway, back to your finances.",
            "client_message": "Definitely! As I was saying earlier, I'm keeping track of everything carefully."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm curious to hear more about your mortgage with Sunshine Bank. Can you tell me a bit about it?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Alexa! I have a mortgage with them, and it's a big part of my financial landscape."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! Let's dive into some details. How much is the monthly cost you're managing right now?",
            "client_message": "The monthly payment is $1,200, which is pretty manageable for us at the moment."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And what's the current outstanding value on your mortgage?",
            "client_message": "The outstanding amount is $250,000. We're slowly chipping away at it."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I see. And do you know what interest rate you're currently on?",
            "client_message": "Yes, it's 3.5% at the moment. We got a decent deal when we locked it in."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds reasonable. Do you have a special rate term or is it just the usual rate?",
            "client_message": "We actually have a special rate of 2.9% fixed until 2028, which gives us some peace of mind."
        },

            "advisor_message": "I guess while we pause for a moment, have you tried any good coffee or tea lately? I find it's a nice way to relax between tasks.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Definitely! I love a strong coffee in the morning to kickstart my day, but a calming herbal tea in the evening is just perfect.",

            "advisor_message": "And you've marked this as an essential expense, continuing until 2030, correct?",

            "advisor_message": "Given your previous experiences with financial plans, how are you feeling about your current strategy?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Winter might bring more indoor activities like streaming while warmer months might see higher spending on outdoor hobbies.",

            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about any discretionary expenses you might have?",

        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! And how often do you pay for that service?",

            "advisor_message": "Great, let's break this down. You’re currently paying $950 annually for car insurance, and it looks like you’ve got that budgeted as an essential expense until 2030. Is that right?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, that’s correct. I mean, it's, uh, something I really need to keep up with, you know?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, it’s important to prioritize that. Now, there’s also the car maintenance expense at $300 quarterly. Would you consider this essential as well, or just important?",
            "client_message": "I’d say it’s important, definitely important, but it’s ongoing, so not really on the same level as the insurance."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it, so ongoing maintenance is a priority but important rather than essential. Ensuring regular maintenance will help with minimizing unexpected larger repairs down the line. Does that align with your approach?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, exactly, that's what I'm thinking too. It's like, uh, taking preventative action, right?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly. This kind of planning will help you maintain a steady budget. Do you have any concerns or other questions about these expenses?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear about the art collection! How about your other collections?",

            "advisor_message": "Wonderful, it's nice to see those appreciating as well. And what about your wine collection?",

            "advisor_message": "It certainly sounds like it. Each of your collections seems to be appreciating nicely. Do these align with your overall financial goals?",

            "advisor_message": "Great to hear! And just to confirm, the policy number for that is DC-202305-FOS. It's crucial to keep that number handy for any official correspondence.",
