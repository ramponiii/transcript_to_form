            "advisor_message": "That's good to hear. How's your work-life balance these days?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "I can imagine. It's all about finding that balance. Have you had any time for hobbies or relaxation?",

            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, creativity can be such a great outlet. Do you find it helpful with managing stress?",

            "advisor_message": "It sounds like you’re really using art to its full potential. Do you showcase any of your work?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Great, and are you still holding the national insurance number QQ987654B?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Just confirming, you're currently self-employed as a freelance graphic designer, right?",

            "advisor_message": "One more thing—you're paying the highest rate of tax at 40%?",
            "client_message": "That's right, I'm in the higher tax bracket. It's a bit high, but that's part of being self-employed, I guess."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Since we're discussing finances, do you keep your paperwork organized at home? That can make managing taxes and freelance income much easier.",
            "client_message": "I try to keep things organized. It's not always easy, but I make an effort to declutter regularly."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's smart. Sometimes just small steps like labeling folders or dedicating a space for bills can make a big difference.",
            "client_message": "Yes, I've found that having separate folders for different types of documentation helps a lot."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I completely agree. And maybe setting aside a specific time each month to sort through things could help keep it manageable.",
            "client_message": "That's a good idea. I'll try to do that to avoid the pile-up."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Boston is a fantastic city. Let's cover some basics. What is your date of birth?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for that. Are you currently single or married?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. And in terms of your contact information, could you confirm your mobile phone number for me?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, my mobile number is 617-555-0456."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. Last thing, just to make sure our profiles are up to date, can you verify your email address for me?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, so with all that squared away, I was wondering if you’ve been keeping up with any of the local sports teams lately? I know Boston has some passionate fans.",
            "client_message": "Oh, absolutely! The energy here is amazing, especially when any of our teams are playing. It’s always exciting to follow along with the games."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about your current state of health and any related details?",
            "client_message": "Sure, I'm generally healthy. I go for regular check-ups, maintain a balanced diet, and exercise regularly, so no major health concerns for now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear, Mia. And do you have any plans or need for long-term care in the foreseeable future?",
            "client_message": "I don’t foresee any immediate need for long-term care. Everything's pretty stable on that front."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Good to know. Let’s touch on a few planning essentials—do you have a will in place?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I do. I created my will back in 2021, and it’s safely stored with my lawyer."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Excellent, having that organized is crucial. Do you also have a power of attorney documented?",
            "client_message": "I do! My brother, Alex Thompson, holds the power of attorney for me. He's great with these responsibilities."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Fantastic—it sounds like you’re well-prepared. Just to confirm, you're not a smoker, right?",
            "client_message": "That’s right, I don’t smoke at all."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, everything sounds well-organized. Speaking of homes, do you remember your childhood neighborhood?",
            "client_message": "Oh, definitely. I grew up in a quaint little town with lots of green parks and a nice community feel."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds idyllic. Were there any particular spots you loved visiting?",
            "client_message": "Yes, there was this old library we used to have, with the creaky wooden floors and a secret reading nook—it's one of my fondest memories."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about your current living situation?",
            "client_message": "Sure! I’m currently renting an apartment. It’s a cozy place."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s great to hear, Mia. Where are you situated at the moment?",
            "client_message": "I live in London, right on Downing Street. It’s quite a historic spot!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Wow, Downing Street! That must be fascinating. Can you remind me of your specific address there?",
            "client_message": "Of course, it’s 10 Downing Street, SW1A 1AA. It feels pretty central to everything."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And when did you move in? I assume it’s been a little while?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I moved in back on May 15, 2020, so it’s been a few years now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for confirming. Just to clarify, this is your current address, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that’s right. I’m still living there in Greater London."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of London, did you get a chance to enjoy any local events or outings recently? I know there’s always something happening in the city.",
            "client_message": "Yeah, the other weekend I checked out a fun street festival nearby. It was a great way to unwind and soak in the lively atmosphere. How about you, any exciting plans?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds delightful! I've been thinking of visiting a museum this weekend. There's a new exhibition opening, and I've heard good things about it.",
            "client_message": "Museums are always a good idea. It's nice to have a balance between the bustling festival vibe and a calming museum visit, isn’t it?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Next, I'd like to explore your dependents and understand how we can support them as part of your financial planning.",
            "client_message": "Sure, that sounds important. I have two kids, so their future is definitely a priority for me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, let's go over their details. Can we start with Ella?",
            "client_message": "Of course. Ella is my oldest. She was born on August 15, 2010. Such a wonderful kid!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Ella will be dependent on you until she's 18, which would be around August 15, 2028, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly. I want to ensure she has all the support she needs until then."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. And what about Max?",
            "client_message": "Max was born on September 22, 2012. He's quite a handful, but I love his curiosity."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "So, his dependency period will run until September 22, 2030. We'll make sure to consider both of your children in our planning.",
            "client_message": "That would be great! I really want to make sure they have everything they need."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Is there anything else you'd like us to consider while we're discussing this? Maybe how your mornings typically start, just to understand your day-to-day routine a bit better.",
            "client_message": "Oh, my mornings are pretty busy with getting the kids ready for school. It's always a bit of a rush."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I can imagine! How do you manage to fit everything in and get out the door on time?",
            "client_message": "I've gotten used to it over the years. We have a pretty set routine that helps."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. Having a routine can really set a positive tone for the day.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, it makes everything run more smoothly."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To switch gears, could you elaborate on your monthly housing expenses, Mia?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Jordan! My main housing expense is my mortgage payment."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and what amount are we looking at for that payment?",
            "client_message": "It's $1800 monthly. It's a significant chunk of my budget."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Would you consider it an essential expense in your financial planning?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, it's definitely essential. I prioritize it above everything else."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Is there a specific timeframe you're looking at for this payment plan, or are you more focused on the present?",
            "client_message": "I'm mostly focused on the present right now, not really thinking about a specific timeframe at the moment."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Okay, thanks for sharing that. Ensuring your mortgage is well-managed is key to maintaining financial stability, especially as it's a priority for you.",
            "client_message": "Exactly, that's why I want to have a clear plan around it to avoid any issues."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Makes total sense. It's great to have that clarity when making financial plans. Speaking of getting around, do you rely on public transportation much, or do you drive most places?",
            "client_message": "I usually drive. Public transportation here is okay, but I'm more comfortable with my car."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Mind if I ask you a few more questions about your current income situation, Mia?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Jordan! I'm excited to dive in and learn more about what I can do with my earnings."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! Let's start with some basics. Can you confirm your current salary at Tech Innovations?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely! I’m earning $75,000 annually there, but that's before taxes."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. So that figure is your gross income, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, it's my gross income. I like to have the big picture in mind."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. And this is from your current employment, right? Just want to make sure we’re all up to date.",
            "client_message": "Yes, everything’s current. I’ve been with Tech Innovations for a while now and really enjoy it!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Excellent. It sounds like you’re in a great position. Let’s think about how we can best use this income to support your financial future. Anything else you’re curious about right now?",
            "client_message": "I’m all ears! I want to ensure I'm making smart choices as I go along."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of planning, with the holidays coming up, a lot of people start reviewing their finances for the new year. It can be a great time to think about financial goals for 2024, wouldn't you agree?",
            "client_message": "Definitely! The holidays always get me in the planning mindset. Plus, I want to make sure I’m ready for any extra expenses."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Moving onto your mortgage details, Mia. Let's make sure we have everything covered here. You've got a mortgage with Sunrise Financial Bank, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. I've been with them for a while now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and you're currently paying $1,500 per month. Does that sound correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's the amount. It's manageable, but I'm curious about if I can optimize it."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, and you have an outstanding balance of $250,000. Now, I noticed your interest rate is 3.8%, but you also have a special rate of 2.5% fixed until 2028. Does that give you some comfort in planning?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, it definitely helps to know that's stable until 2028, though I'm always looking for ways to make it even better."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Think of your mortgage like planting a tree. We’ve got a fixed rate, like fertile soil until 2028, helping the tree, or your financial future, grow steadily. Then it adjusts, like weather changes. That's something to prepare for by keeping an eye on your overall financial landscape as we approach 2045, your final payment date. Sound good?",
            "client_message": "That sounds like a really clear way to look at it! I do like the stability of planning for growth over the long term."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Excellent! Let's keep watch for opportunities to refinance if rates drop further. Always good to understand what's on the horizon. Do you have any other questions about this setup?",
            "client_message": "No, I think that covers everything! I'll definitely stay tuned for any refinancing opportunities."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of staying on top of things, how's everything going with your car? Any maintenance issues lately?",
            "client_message": "Nothing too major, thankfully. I did have to take it in for a routine check-up recently."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's good to hear. Those check-ups can really help in avoiding bigger issues down the line.",
            "client_message": "Exactly. It was just the usual oil change and tire rotation. Always feels good to check it off the list."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Definitely a must-do. Better to keep on top of those things than let them pile up, right?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely. It's all about prevention. Just like with finances, I guess!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'd like to hear your thoughts on your current loan repayments, Mia. How are you handling those commitments?",
            "client_message": "Well, I've got a couple of loans I'm managing. The student loan is pretty much a fixed thing—it’s $350 monthly until 2027, which I see as essential to keep on track."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's good to have clarity on. And besides the student loan, do you have any other loan commitments?",
            "client_message": "Yes, there's also a personal loan I'm dealing with. It’s $200 every month, and it’s important to me to have it fully repaid by 2025."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Those are significant commitments. Do you prioritize one over the other?",
            "client_message": "I’d say the student loan is definitely essential because it’s tied to my education. The personal loan is important too, but in a different way—it gives me more flexibility with my finances."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Balancing those can be challenging. How comfortable do you feel with your current repayment setup?",
            "client_message": "I’m okay with the setup for now. I just need to make sure I don't miss any payments, as both are crucial to my financial plan."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, staying on top of those payments is key. Is there anything you feel uncertain about that we can discuss further?",
            "client_message": "Not at the moment, but I’d like to revisit our plan down the line, especially as 2025 approaches. I want to make sure I'm on track."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "By the way, how's everything else going with your daily routine, like your commute or any other day-to-day tasks?",
            "client_message": "Oh, it’s been good mostly. Although, my car's been acting up a bit recently. Just some minor things, nothing serious yet."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Oh no, that's always a bit stressful. What's been going on with it?",
            "client_message": "Just the usual maintenance stuff, I guess. The oil needs changing, and there's a weird noise sometimes when I start it up."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Okay, $120 for fuel and $350 for the car lease. Both monthly and ongoing. Those sound like key items in your budget.",

        },

            "advisor_message": "I used to collect stamps with my grandfather. We'd spend hours looking at them, and he would tell me the stories behind each one. It was fascinating.",

            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a great addition! Is this a high priority for you or more of a discretionary expense?",

            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a wonderful plan. Are these getaways a priority for you compared to your other expenses?",
