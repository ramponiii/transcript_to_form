        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Have you been keeping up with any local sports lately?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's talk about some of your essential housing expenses, Emily. I noticed you have a mortgage payment listed. Could you share more about that?",

            "advisor_message": "Sounds good. And what about property taxes? How are you managing those?",
            "client_message": "I pay property taxes annually, which are around $6,000. They're ongoing, so I always account for them in my yearly budget."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great planning on your part. Would you say both the mortgage payment and the property taxes are essential priorities in your financial strategy?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Very true. And just like with a garden, sometimes we need to reassess and maybe trim or adjust things to keep everything flourishing.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That predictability is definitely a benefit. How does this fit into your overall financial strategy? Are there specific goals you're aiming for with this income?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a sound approach. Keeping it ongoing and reliable gives you a solid base to work with. Have you considered how this might evolve over time, or are there any changes you anticipate?",

        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a solid plan. And how about any other loans?",

            "advisor_message": "That's a sensible approach, especially with such a valuable collection. Do you have any particular goals in mind for this asset? For instance, are you considering using it for future liquidity?",
