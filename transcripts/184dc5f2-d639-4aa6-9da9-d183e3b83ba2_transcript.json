        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s great, staying active is important. And how about any other activities or hobbies you invest in?",
            "client_message": "I’m really into cooking, so I take quarterly cooking classes that cost around $200 each time. It’s more of a fun project for me, not a must-have, but I want to continue it for at least another year."

            "advisor_message": "I completely agree. Sometimes the right book can offer just the right escape. Do you have a favorite author whose work you turn to?",

            "advisor_message": "I'd like to hear your thoughts on how you're managing your professional expenses currently. Are there specific costs you'd like us to focus on for better tax efficiency?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Rachel! I have a few regular expenses that I think about. For example, I attend a conference every year, which costs about $1,200. I also have to renew a professional certification every three years, costing $350. Plus, there's an online course subscription I pay $300 for each quarter, and I'm planning to keep it until 2026."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for sharing that, Daniel. The conference attendance fees seem like an important, ongoing cost that could potentially be managed more tax-efficiently. Do you consider these fees as important for your career progression?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely. These conferences are really vital for networking and keeping up-to-date with industry trends, so I definitely see them as important."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes a lot of sense. As for the certification renewal, since it's essential and comes up every three years, it might be worth predicting its impact on your budget for 2025, your next renewal year. How do you prioritize this spending?",
            "client_message": "I think it's essential because I need to maintain my credentials to stay competitive in my field. So, even though it’s not annual, it’s high on my list when the time comes around again."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. And the online course subscription—being quarterly, which is quite frequent, and discretionary, are you finding it's worthwhile keeping it until 2026?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I think so. It helps me learn new skills at my own pace, and I believe it’s a good investment for my professional development."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, keeping your goals in mind, let's look at how we can structure these expenses for better tax efficiency. Maximizing deductions where possible could help save some costs over time. How does that sound?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of which, as we look into these financial aspects, have you noticed how the seasons are shifting these days? It really feels like the year's moving so fast, doesn't it?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, Rachel. It's quite something how summer seems to be fading quickly, but I always find some excitement in preparing for the changes. There's something refreshing about it."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I know what you mean. There's a certain energy that comes with the transition of seasons. It's a great time to reflect and refocus, especially when it comes to planning ahead.",

            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. And it's in trust, so it's secure for my family. It's set to last until 2050, which feels like a good timeframe."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely. Having it in trust ensures it will reach your family efficiently. Let's also talk about your Income Protection policy with Aviva. How do you feel about that one?",
            "client_message": "I'm quite comfortable with it. It's £50,000 of coverage, primarily in case I can't work due to an illness or injury. I believe it lasts until 2045."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Yes, it does. The £45.75 monthly cost seems manageable for you?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Great to hear it's been steady. Now, moving on to your Investment Bond with Fidelity. How do you feel about that investment?",
