        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense, keeping it essential ensures itâ€™s top of mind. How confident do you feel about managing this payment long-term?",

            "advisor_message": "Great, consistency is key. Now, letâ€™s talk about your personal loan repayments. How's that structured?",
            "client_message": "For the personal loan, Iâ€™m paying $200 each month. The plan is to pay it off by 2027, but itâ€™s more flexible than my student loan."

        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. So while it's important, you have some leeway compared to the student loan, correct?",

            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. It sounds like it's an important part of your routine. Given that it's $75 monthly, do you see it as a priority in your budget, or more of a discretionary expense?",
            "client_message": "I consider it discretionary. I mean, it's nice to have, but if I needed to cut back, I could live without it."
        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly, and when we think about how those principles apply to financial planning, itâ€™s about finding that balance and steady approach, much like a good novel where every chapter builds on the last.",

        },
