            "advisor_message": "Got it. And are you still single, or is there a new development in your marital status?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Classic rock has such a great energy. Do you ever go to any concerts, or is it more about listening at home?",
            "client_message": "I love going to live shows when I can. There's nothing like the atmosphere of a concert, feeling the music fill the space around you."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's pivot and discuss your current health and any related plans, Marcus. How are you feeling these days?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Having those plans in place provides a lot of peace of mind. Just to clarify, you mentioned you're not a smoker, correct?",
            "client_message": "Exactly, I don’t smoke. Never have, actually."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Spring is coming up, and it's always a great time to reassess living situations, right? Have you made any plans for the holidays?",
            "client_message": "Not really, I tend to keep it low-key. Spring is nice to just relax and enjoy the city."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's true, London does have a special charm in the spring. Speaking of plans, let's shift back and talk a bit more about your current living situation, Marcus. Are you still renting at 15A Baker Street in London?",

            "advisor_message": "Great, thanks for confirming. Now, I see your previous residence was owned, correct? That was at Flat 10 on Kings Road in Chelsea?",
            "client_message": "Exactly! I owned that place in Chelsea and lived there starting March 10th, 2018, before moving to my current rental."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And just to clarify, you're still renting in the NW1 6XE postcode, right?",

        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's good to have that experience. Understanding where and how you've moved helps me tailor your financial strategies. Let's discuss how these moves relate to your long-term plans.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "By the way, Marcus, how are your mornings these days? Managing to get enough rest?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "No worries, Marcus. Could you tell me more about the types of debt you're dealing with, like any credit card debt, student loans, or maybe a mortgage? This will help us prioritize them effectively.",
            "client_message": "Okay, I’ve got some credit card debt and a small car loan. No student loans thankfully, but we are thinking about a mortgage. It’s mostly these smaller day-to-day debts that I want to tackle."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, it's good to hear there's no student loan to worry about. Handling your credit card debt first is generally a smart move due to the interest rates. For the mortgage, how does that fit into your longer-term plans, especially considering Ella's future expenses?",
            "client_message": "Well, we’re hoping to buy a house in the next few years, so I want to balance that with saving for Ella, since she'll probably need support until she’s about 18, around June 2028."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Planning for Ella’s needs as a dependent until June 2028 is a wise approach. Balancing that with a potential mortgage can be challenging, but it’s definitely manageable with a good strategy.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Before we dive into inflation strategies, let’s briefly talk about organizing your home. A well-organized space can really contribute to a sense of clarity and reduce daily stress. Do you ever tackle any decluttering projects or rearrange things to keep your home feeling fresh and functional?",
            "client_message": "Actually, I do try to keep things tidy. I find that organizing different areas, like the kitchen or home office, helps maintain a smoother daily routine."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s a great habit. Sometimes starting small with one room or even a single closet can make a big difference. Plus, having a designated spot for everything makes it easier to keep track of things. Do you have any favorite methods or tips that have worked well for you?",

            "advisor_message": "That's an effective strategy! Keeping that balance is key. Now, shifting back to inflation planning, as we previously mentioned, setting aside a buffer each month could be beneficial. How does that approach sound to you?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I see, and it's important to have a firm grasp on those essential costs. How about any additional housing-related expenses?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "That's a great way to prioritize. Knowing that these are your consistent monthly costs, how do you foresee inflation impacting them?",

            "advisor_message": "Inflation can definitely influence such expenses, potentially leading to rent increases and adjustments in insurance premiums. It's wise to plan for these changes. Have you thought about how you might adjust your budget to accommodate these shifts?",

            "advisor_message": "A good approach might be to periodically review your budget and consider setting aside some additional funds each month as a buffer. This could help absorb any cost increases without straining your finances. Would you like us to explore some more specific strategies for this together?",

            "advisor_message": "Have you been able to take any time off recently, maybe a vacation or just a short trip to clear your mind?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's really beneficial to step away now and then, even a simple getaway can be refreshing. Any particular spots you've been dreaming of?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Given these income streams, understanding inflation can help us plan your financial future more effectively. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding purchasing power. Over time, the same dollar might buy you less.",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Exactly. It’s crucial to consider inflation in both your salary and rental income. While the rental amount is ongoing, you might want to assess whether it's sufficient to cover increasing living costs and maintain your desired lifestyle.",

            "advisor_message": "That’s a wise choice. Remember, while it’s not placed in trust like your life assurance, this policy primarily focuses on replacing income, which can offer some tax relief through premiums. We should keep it updated as your situation changes. Lastly, your critical illness cover with Aviva provides $100,000. How does that meet your goals?",
            "client_message": "It's specifically for unexpected medical expenses or income loss from a serious illness, up until 2035. I was told it's best to separate it from the trust, focusing solely on direct benefit."
