            "advisor_message": "I understand. Car insurance is indeed essential, especially for ensuring stability. Let's also look at your monthly expenses. You noted $150 for fuel each month. Together, these add up to important costs we need to manage.",

How do you feel about this collection in terms of its importance to your overall portfolio?",

            "client_message": "The jewellery is a bit more sentimental. I like knowing it has appreciated in value by $5,000, but I don’t have the same attachment to it as I do my art."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That emotional aspect is significant. If you were to use it for liquidity, remember that we would need to consider any applicable taxes or fees. Lastly, there’s your classic car, a 1967 Ford Mustang. You originally purchased it for $60,000, and it's climbed to an impressive $75,000 in value. What are your thoughts here?",
            "client_message": "The Mustang is a treasure for me, especially given its $15,000 increase in value. While it’s reassuring to know its economic worth, it’s not just monetary for me. It’s more about the joy it brings."
