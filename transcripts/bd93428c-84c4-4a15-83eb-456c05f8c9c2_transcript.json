            "advisor_message": "And that's in San Francisco, right? Can you remind me of the postcode and county?",

            "advisor_message": "Have you been working on any home improvement projects in your new place? It can really enhance the feel of your living space.",
            "client_message": "Actually, yes! I've been thinking about starting a small herb garden on the balcony. I think it would be nice to have fresh herbs for cooking."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a great idea! Herbs are usually quite easy to grow and can add a lovely green touch to the balcony.",
            "client_message": "Exactly, and it's such a satisfying feeling to use something you've grown yourself."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Definitely gives you a sense of accomplishment. Plus, it's a good way to unwind after a busy day.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, and it will be fun to watch them grow."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Shifting gears a bit, I'd like to ask about any dependents you have, Jake, as this will help in planning for their future as well.",
            "client_message": "Sure, I have two kids. What details do you need?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! Can you tell me their names and birthdates? That'll help us set up an accurate timeline for when they'll be independent.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely. My son is Lucas Miller, born on June 15, 2015, and my daughter is Ella Miller, born on September 20, 2018."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, thank you. So, considering their birthdates, Lucas will be dependent until June 15, 2033, and Ella until September 20, 2036. It's important to consider these dates when planning college funds or any future support they might need.",
            "client_message": "Got it! That puts things into perspective. I hadn’t really mapped out their dependency period before."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's good to have these milestones in mind. Now, let's touch on inflation a bit, as it affects savings for their future. Simply put, inflation is how prices for goods and services go up over time, which can reduce your purchasing power.",
            "client_message": "Ah, that makes sense. So, it's basically the reason why things cost more now than they did when I was a kid."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly, and that’s why saving for Lucas and Ella should account for inflation to ensure that what you save now retains its value over time.",
            "client_message": "Thanks for breaking it down, Sarah. I definitely want to make sure they're well taken care of."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, speaking of planning for the future, have you seen the new season of that popular TV show everyone’s been talking about? The one about all the different timelines and futures? It's fascinating how they play with the idea of time.",
            "client_message": "Oh, I think I know which one you mean! I’ve seen bits and pieces, but I’m definitely planning to watch it soon. It’s amazing how they manage to weave so many possibilities into the storyline."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely! It really makes you think about how every little detail can change the outcome, kind of like with financial planning.",
            "client_message": "Exactly, it’s like they’re constantly doing the 'what if' scenario, which is a lot like how I’m trying to plan for my kids’ future."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Mind if I ask you a few more questions about your monthly expenses, Jake?",
            "client_message": "Oh, absolutely, Sarah. Please feel free to ask anything you need. I’m more than happy to provide any details that can help."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thank you, Jake. Let’s start with your housing expense. Could you confirm the monthly amount you pay for rent?",
            "client_message": "Of course, my rent is $1,500 each month."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and is this amount consistent every month? Any fluctuations or additional fees?",
            "client_message": "No fluctuations at all. It’s a steady $1,500 every month, which is actually quite reassuring."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s good to know. Would you consider this rent an essential part of your budget?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, it's definitely an essential expense for me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, thank you, Jake. Is there a specific priority you attach to this expense when managing your finances?",
            "client_message": "Yes, it’s a top priority for me. Keeping the roof over my head is crucial."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, that reminds me of trying a new recipe recently. I decided to cook something a bit different for dinner the other night.",
            "client_message": "Oh, what did you make?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It was a homemade pad thai. I came across the recipe online and thought it would be a fun challenge.",
            "client_message": "That sounds delicious! How did it turn out?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Surprisingly well! It was my first time making it, but it tasted pretty authentic. I might make it a regular thing.",
            "client_message": "Nice! I love trying new recipes too. It's such a great way to mix things up and explore new flavors."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm curious to hear more about your current financial situation, Jake. Could you share some details about your various income sources?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Sarah. I mainly earn through my freelance graphic design work, which brings in about $3,000 monthly. That's the net amount after expenses."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. Having a steady income stream is important. How long do you plan to continue with the freelance work?",
            "client_message": "I plan to keep it going for the foreseeable future. I really enjoy the flexibility and creativity, so it's definitely an ongoing thing for me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Fantastic! And aside from your freelance work, do you have any other sources of income we should consider?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I receive dividends from my investment portfolio. They amount to about $450 quarterly, and that's before any deductions, so it's the gross amount."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it, ongoing dividends are a nice addition. It's beneficial to have multiple streams. Are you happy with the investment strategy you're using for those dividends?",
            "client_message": "I am, but I'm always open to new ideas that could make my portfolio even better. I like to explore options but maintain a secure approach."

            "advisor_message": "Could you tell me a little more about your current mortgage situation?",

            "advisor_message": "Do you find it challenging to balance your financial planning with everyday household tasks? Like, do chores ever interfere with managing your budget?",
            "client_message": "Well, it can get a bit hectic trying to juggle everything. But, I find that setting a specific time each week really helps. What about you—do you have a strategy for managing daily chores?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Oh, definitely! I often schedule them just like my meetings. A little structure goes a long way, right?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, it's like running a marathon, not a sprint. What about your car loan? You're paying $420 each month until 2025, correct?",
            "client_message": "Right on. I got the car last year, so that one feels a bit more manageable, but it’s important to me too."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. It's essential to prioritize it since transportation is vital. Would you say these obligations feel manageable at their current levels?",
