            "client_message": "I don't think I need it right now. I’m still pretty independent and active, so I haven’t considered it much."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Understood. And you have a will in place, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, I drafted it last year, in 2022. My family lawyer is holding it."

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for sharing that. By the way, ever have those days where everything seems to go wrong? Like, you finally decide to make a quick store run, and you end up in the longest checkout line?",
            "client_message": "Oh, tell me about it! Just last week, I thought I’d be in and out of the store, and I got stuck behind someone with a cartload of groceries. It’s like Murphy’s Law in action."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly! Or when you can’t find your keys when you’re already running late.",
            "client_message": "That happens to me all the time! It’s like they grow legs and walk away. I usually find them in the weirdest places."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "The struggle is real! Anyway, back to what we were discussing.",
            "client_message": "Sure thing!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Can we talk about your current living situation? It would help me understand how factors like inflation might impact your financial planning.",
            "client_message": "Sure, no problem. What do you need to know?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let’s start with your address. Could you confirm the details for me?",
            "client_message": "I'm at 123 Elm Street, Beverly Hills, California, in Los Angeles County, to be exact. The postcode is 90210."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Thank you. And is this home owned or rented?",

            "advisor_message": "Great. And when did you move in?",
            "client_message": "I moved in on June 15, 2020."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, thank you. Understanding your homeownership and location helps when we consider inflation’s impact on costs related to property and living expenses. Is there anything specific you’re curious about regarding inflation?",
            "client_message": "I guess, just how it might affect my living costs here. I've heard it can make a big difference."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, while we're discussing your living situation, have you noticed any interesting wildlife around your area?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. Birdwatching can be quite a relaxing hobby. Do you have any favorites you've spotted?",
            "client_message": "Oh, definitely. There's a family of blue jays that always seems to be around."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Blue jays are beautiful, and they're known for their intelligence. It's always nice to have some wildlife around your home.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, they've become a familiar part of the neighborhood."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's talk about any dependents you might have, Jake. This helps us understand your financial responsibilities better.",
            "client_message": "Sure, I have a daughter. Her name is Sophie Thompson."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, thanks for sharing that. Can you tell me Sophie's date of birth? It will help us calculate how long she'll be dependent on you financially.",
            "client_message": "Yeah, she was born on July 15th, 2012."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, so she's 11 years old right now. Typically, we would consider her dependent until around age 18. Does that align with your plans?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that sounds about right. So, until she's 18, in 2030."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly, until July 15th, 2030. Understanding this timeline helps us plan accordingly for her future needs.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Alright, let’s make sure we incorporate this into our broader financial strategy so that Sophie's needs are well taken care of.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, I appreciate that. Okay, I gotta run now. Let's catch up later."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Before you go, I wanted to get your thoughts on something light. Have you tried any new types of bread lately, Jake?",
            "client_message": "Oh, I've actually been getting into sourdough lately. It's got a nice tangy flavor that I really enjoy."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Sourdough is amazing! There's something special about that tangy taste, isn't there? Have you experimented with making it yourself or just buying it from a bakery?",
            "client_message": "I’ve just been buying it for now, but I’ve thought about trying to bake it myself. It seems like it could be a fun project."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, baking bread can be a rewarding experience. And with sourdough, there's the added fun of maintaining the starter. Lots of people find it quite the hobby.",
            "client_message": "Yeah, I've heard about that. It sounds interesting. Maybe I’ll give it a shot one of these days."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Now, regarding the mortgage payments, Jake, can you tell me a bit more about how they're structured?",
            "client_message": "Sure, I pay $1500 every month. It's a pretty important part of my expenses."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and how long do you expect to continue with these payments?",
            "client_message": "Well, the plan is to keep paying until 2040. That’s when it's supposed to be paid off."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Would you say that this mortgage payment is a high priority for you?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, it's essential. I need to make sure it’s covered every month."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I understand. It’s definitely important to keep housing expenses at the top of the priority list. Do you have any concerns about maintaining these payments?",
            "client_message": "Not really, I'm pretty steady with them. Just want to make sure I’m on track."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You’re doing a great job, Jake. Keeping stability in your housing expenses provides a strong foundation for your financial planning. If you have any questions or need adjustments in the future, I’m here to help.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, maintaining a regular exercise routine is similar in some ways to financial planning. It's all about consistency and making small, manageable commitments, right?",
            "client_message": "I completely agree. I try to stay active by mixing cardio, like jogging, with some strength training."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a great balance. Do you find that sticking to a routine helps in other areas of your life, like keeping up with financial commitments?",
            "client_message": "Definitely. Having a set schedule for workouts helps me stay disciplined, which carries over to managing my finances."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes a lot of sense. It’s interesting how both fitness and financial health benefit from routine and dedication.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Next, I'd like to explore your income sources, Jake, so we can have a clearer picture of your financial landscape. Can you share a bit about your current salary and any other sources of income?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Perfect. Now, do you have any additional sources of income we should include in our planning?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I do a bit of freelance writing on the side. It brings in about $1,200 a month, and that’s net income."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s wonderful, Jake. So, you're receiving this $1,200 monthly as well, and it's net, which means taxes are already taken out, correct?",
            "client_message": "Exactly. It's after taxes, and I’ve been doing it for quite some time now, so it’s ongoing."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for clarifying that. Having both a steady salary and ongoing freelance work really provides a nice balance. We can use this to better build towards your financial goals.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Cats can be such characters. Mine insists on sitting right in the middle of my papers when I’m working. What about Whiskers? Any quirky habits?",
            "client_message": "Whiskers has taken to chasing his shadow around the house. It's like having live entertainment in the living room."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's adorable! They always keep things interesting, don't they?",

            "advisor_message": "I remember when I was a kid, we had this giant oak tree in our backyard. My friends and I would try to climb it every summer. It was such a feat back then, almost like scaling a mountain.",
            "client_message": "That sounds fun! I used to spend summers at my cousins', playing in their giant treehouse. I guess both memories involve trees, right?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, those simple joys tend to stick with us. It’s funny how these memories can come up randomly.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, talking about all these collections and investments reminds me of when I was a kid. We used to collect stamps. My dad had this massive album that was like a treasure chest to me.",
            "client_message": "Really? That's such a classic collection. I bet it was fascinating. Did you ever find any rare ones?"
        },

        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "No worries, Jake. We also have your State Pension to think about. Although it doesn’t have a specific provider, do you have any questions about how it works or how it fits into your overall plan?",
            "client_message": "Honestly, I feel a bit in the dark about it. Can you give me a simple rundown? It’s all a bit much with the paperwork involved."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Of course. The State Pension is basically what you’ll receive from the government once you reach the eligible age. It’s calculated based on your National Insurance record, and there’s generally no need for extra paperwork on your end right now.",
            "client_message": "That sounds straightforward enough! I appreciate you clearing that up without all the extra forms to fill out."
        },

            "client_message": "Sure, Anne. I’m spending around $50 each month on my gym membership. It’s kind of my way to stay active and unwind, but I see it as more of a discretionary expense."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, it’s good to have that balance. How about any other monthly subscriptions? Anything else you'd classify as discretionary?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, I also have a streaming services subscription that costs $15.99 monthly. It's my go-to when I need to relax, but again, it’s not something I can’t live without."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Having some entertainment is definitely nice. Now, do you have any essential expenses related to your lifestyle that you'd like to mention?",
            "client_message": "Well, I can’t forget about pet care. I’m spending about $75 a month on it. That’s definitely essential since those expenses are for my dog’s food and vet visits."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Pets are part of the family, after all. Are these expenses fitting comfortably within your current financial goals, or are there adjustments you’re considering?",
            "client_message": "Right now they fit okay, but I’m always open to ideas on how to budget better, especially if it helps me save in the long run."
        },

        },

            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So, just to confirm, this is an ongoing commitment, correct?",
