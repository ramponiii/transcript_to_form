            "advisor_message": "That’s a very health-conscious approach. Out of curiosity, what kind of exercises do you focus on at the gym?",

            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. You’ve labeled the gym membership as ‘important,’ and it's ongoing. Is there a specific reason you consider it crucial?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "That's wonderful. Has the appreciation of these assets impacted your financial goals or future plans?",

            "client_message": "Well, I've, uh, been thinking about using the art collection as a sort of financial cushion for, like, any unforeseen events or maybe even retirement. The car? It's more of a, um, passion project. I like the idea of passing it down someday."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, talking about cars makes me think of my own early fascination with them. When I was a kid, I remember spending weekends at my grandfather's garage. He had this knack for fixing up old cars, and I would watch him for hours. It was amazing how he'd bring those engines back to life.",
            "client_message": "That's such a nice memory, Nathan. I can definitely relate. My Dad and I used to bond over fixing up an old motorcycle when I was younger. Those are the kind of memories that stick with you."

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s a crucial concern, Rachel. Inflation can erode purchasing power, especially over long periods like retirement saving. It's vital to ensure that your investments are positioned to outpace inflation.",

            "advisor_message": "That sounds delicious! Pizza from scratch must have been quite the undertaking. How did it turn out?",
            "client_message": "It actually turned out really well! The crust was a bit thicker than I planned, but it was so satisfying to customize it exactly the way I wanted. I might try a thin crust next time."
