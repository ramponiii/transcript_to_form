            "advisor_message": "Alright, thanks for confirming all that, Emma. Now, before we dive into more details, I just wanted to share a little tip unrelated to our main discussion. Have you ever tried organizing household items by category? It's amazing how much space you can save and how streamlined everything feels afterward.",
            "client_message": "Oh, I haven't thought of categorizing that way, but it sounds interesting. I might need to give that a try. I'm always looking for ways to keep my space tidy."

        },
        {

        },
        {

            "client_message": "Yes, that's exactly what I've planned. It's a big commitment, but it's essential for our home's security."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, managing such commitments is crucial. Now, regarding your home insurance, you have a monthly payment of $90. How do you feel about that expense?",
            "client_message": "It feels important to have that coverage, especially given how unpredictable things can be. I consider it a necessary safety net."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I agree. It's an important part of maintaining peace of mind. Would you say these expenses are prioritized correctly in your budget, with the mortgage being essential and the insurance being important but slightly lower in priority?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's how I see it too. The mortgage definitely comes first, but I wouldn't want to go without the insurance either."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great to hear you have a clear view on this. Keeping these priorities in mind will help us plan further for any future changes or opportunities.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Herbal teas are great for relaxing. I suppose coffee has its strong flavor fans too. It's interesting how preferences can vary so widely.",

        },
        {

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! Let's start with the basics. I see you have a mortgage with Blue Ridge Mortgages. How has your experience been with them so far?",
            "client_message": "They’ve been pretty good! I’ve been happy with their service, especially since I've got a special rate locked in until 2028."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. So, your fixed rate is 2.8% until 2028. After that, it will shift, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly. I was really excited to secure that low rate for such a long term."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And your current monthly payment is $1,450, correct? Also, do you know the outstanding value on your mortgage?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Shifting gears a bit, I'd like to ask about any loans you might be currently repaying, Emma.",
