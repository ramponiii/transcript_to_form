        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Good call! Once we sort essentials, the rest should fall into place easier. How’s your rental situation holding up?",

            "advisor_message": "That sounds like an exciting position! Being employed since 2018 shows great stability. Could you share your highest rate of tax paid? I see it might be at the 40% rate; is that correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right, I pay the higher rate of 40% tax. It’s one of those things, right?"
        },

        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s great to hear! And you’re not a smoker, correct?",
            "client_message": "Nope, never picked up the habit. Cigarettes aren’t really my thing."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Good to know. So, do you foresee any need for long-term care in the near future?",
            "client_message": "Honestly, I don’t think so. I’m feeling pretty good, and there’s no indication right now that I’ll need any long-term care."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Do you have a will, Ethan?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I do. I actually created it last year, in 2022. It’s kept in a safe at home."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And for power of attorney, who have you designated for that role?",
            "client_message": "My sister, Emma Larson. She holds the power of attorney."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Before we move forward, sometimes it's fun to reflect a bit. Do you ever think back to where you grew up?",
            "client_message": "Oh, definitely! I remember this one time when I built a huge snowman in our backyard with my sister, Emma. We spent the entire afternoon gathering snow and shaping it. It was so much fun! We even used old scarves and hats to decorate it. It's little things like that that stick with you, you know?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a wonderful memory! It's nice how those little moments can bring a smile even years later. Now, let's talk about your current living situation, Ethan. Where are you currently residing?",

        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for that. And just to confirm, when did you move into this place?",
            "client_message": "I moved in on June 15th last year, 2022."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. And this address is in San Francisco County, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly. San Francisco County, USA."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thank you, Ethan. It's really important for our records to have everything correct. Are there any other details you'd like to discuss about your living situation?",
            "client_message": "No, that's pretty much it. Thanks for making this so straightforward, Olivia!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of home situations, have you considered any gardening or home improvement projects? It’s sometimes a nice way to make a rented place feel more like home.",
            "client_message": "Actually, I have thought about it. I was considering starting a small herb garden on the balcony."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds wonderful! Herbs are great because they’re low maintenance, and you can use them in your cooking. Any specific types you’re thinking of planting?",
            "client_message": "I’m thinking of starting with basil and mint. They’re my go-to for a lot of dishes, plus they smell amazing!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great choices! Basil and mint are both versatile and fragrant. Let me know if you need any tips on how to keep them thriving.",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Great, can you remind me of her birth date?",
            "client_message": "Of course! Sophia was born on June 15, 2010."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. So, she'll be your dependent until she's 18, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right. She'll be dependent until June 15, 2028."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for confirming these details. They're crucial for understanding your portfolio, especially when we think about future planning and education costs.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely! I want to ensure we're set up for any education expenses and other needs as they come up."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly. We'll keep these in mind as we analyze your options and align them with your goals.",
            "client_message": "Sounds great, Olivia, I’m looking forward to seeing what we can do."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "By the way, have you checked out any new restaurants around here lately? I heard there's a new place on Main Street that's been getting great reviews.",
            "client_message": "Oh, I haven't yet, but I've heard about that spot. I think it's called The Golden Fork?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Yeah, that's the one! I passed by last weekend and it looked quite busy. People are really raving about their desserts.",
            "client_message": "I might have to give it a try then. It’s always nice to have new local spots to explore."

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "There's also that little bakery that opened up a couple of months ago on 5th street. They make really good pastries!",
            "client_message": "Pastries are my weakness! I’ll definitely have to stop by there soon."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let me know what you think if you do. I love hearing feedback on these little places, helps me refine my list of must-visits.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's explore your current monthly expenses, Ethan. I know we touched on housing costs briefly. Could you remind me how much you currently pay for rent?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Olivia! My rent is $1800 a month."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and you mentioned that this is one of your essential expenses, right?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely. Rent is something I definitely prioritize each month."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Alright, so it's $1800 monthly, and I assume this expense doesn’t fluctuate? It stays consistent?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, thank you for clarifying. It’s key for us to account for these essential, steady payments in our financial planning.",

        },
        {

            "client_message": "Exactly! That flexibility is what I'm hoping to keep while managing the essentials. Thanks for understanding, Olivia!"
        },

            "advisor_message": "Speaking of managing essentials, how do you keep track of all your household chores along with everything else?",
            "client_message": "Oh, I have a bit of a system for that. I like to make lists and try to stick to a schedule. It helps me keep on top of things."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a smart approach! Do you find certain chores more challenging to keep up with than others?",
            "client_message": "Definitely. Honestly, laundry seems like it's never-ending. Everything else is fairly manageable with a schedule."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I totally understand—laundry can take up a surprising amount of time. Do you have any specific strategies for getting it done efficiently?",
            "client_message": "I usually set aside a specific day for it. That way, I know it's coming, and I can plan around it."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a good strategy. Having a routine really helps in balancing everything. So, speaking of balance, let's dive back into discussing your income streams.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, let's get back to it!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Mind if I ask you a few more questions about your income streams? It would really help us put together the best plan for you.",
            "client_message": "Sure, go ahead! I might get distracted, but I’m listening."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! So, let's start with your freelance photography. How much are you bringing in from that each month?",
            "client_message": "Oh, that's bringing in about $7,500 monthly. It's been a steady gig for a while now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Is that amount net or gross? You know, before or after taxes?",
            "client_message": "Oh, that's net. I’ve already sorted out taxes, thankfully!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. And I assume this is ongoing?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, definitely ongoing. As long as I have my camera, I'm in business!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Excellent! Now, about your rental income from the apartment—how much are you earning there each month?",
            "client_message": "That’s $1,200, but that's gross, so I still need to handle expenses and taxes out of that."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I remember having this old, bulky camera as a kid. It was one of those point-and-shoot ones. My dad taught me how to use it during a summer trip to the beach. To this day, it amazes me how a photo could freeze time and bring back the smell of the ocean and the laughter from that day. Those early snapshots fueled my fascination with capturing moments.",
            "client_message": "That's such a nice memory! Funny enough, my parents had a similar camera, and I used to pretend I was a pro photographer, taking 'portraits' of my dolls and toys around the house. I guess that playful start led to my interest in photography later on."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm curious to hear more about your goals for managing your mortgage. What are your thoughts on the long-term impact of your current loan terms?",
            "client_message": "Well, Olivia, I’ve been with Sunshine Home Loans for a couple of years now. They set me up with a $250,000 mortgage. I’m trying to ensure the monthly payments of $1500.75 stay manageable as I balance other ventures."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It sounds like you've been proactive. Your interest rate is 3.75%, correct? And do you currently have any special rates?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly. I'm currently on a special rate of 2.5% fixed until 2028. That was one of the main reasons I went with Sunshine Home Loans."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That special rate definitely offers some stability for a few more years. How are you planning to approach the changes once the rate adjustments begin?",
            "client_message": "Honestly, I haven't thought too far beyond 2028 yet. I know the final payment is due by June 1st, 2038, and I want to make sure I'm ready for any rate hikes that might come after the fixed period."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Having a plan is key, especially with the final payment deadline in 2038. Would you like to explore some long-term strategies to manage potential changes in your mortgage terms after 2028?",
            "client_message": "Yes, absolutely! I’d love to keep the flexibility while preparing for those future changes. I still want to pursue new opportunities without feeling constrained by the mortgage."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "A flexible plan can certainly support both stability and growth. Let’s dive into that more and consider some options for refinancing or additional investments as you approach 2028.",

            "advisor_message": "You know, while we're on the topic of financial planning, it reminds me of how I feel about coffee. I often find myself torn between a classic espresso and a smooth latte, depending on my mood. How about you, Ethan? Any preference when it comes to coffee or tea during these long planning sessions?",
            "client_message": "Honestly, I’m more of a tea person. I enjoy a nice green tea in the morning; it helps me think more clearly as I assess these financial plans."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Green tea is fantastic for focus. And it’s also a calming choice amidst all the numbers and figures. Maybe it's like finding the right balance in your mortgage and loans—just the right blend to keep you grounded yet energized. What do you think?",
            "client_message": "Exactly, Olivia. That's a good analogy. It's all about maintaining that balance in both spending and, I guess, my tea preferences too!"
