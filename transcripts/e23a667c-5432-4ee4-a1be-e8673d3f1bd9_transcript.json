        },

            "advisor_message": "Great! I have on record that Oliver was born on April 15th, 2010, is that correct?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I know how quickly the years fly by. Our plan is to support him financially until he turns 18, which would be April 15th, 2028. Does that align with your plans?",
            "client_message": "Yes, supporting him until he's 18 sounds perfect, especially while he's still in school."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, ensuring these timelines are in place helps us plan ahead for his needs, such as education and any other support he might require.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely. I'm keen on making sure his education is priority number one, and having a solid plan is important to me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense, Linda. We can map out some options for education savings to ensure we’re fully prepared. Do you have any specific goals or concerns about his future you want to discuss further?",
            "client_message": "I think just having a clear plan for his college expenses is essential. Beyond that, I want to keep things flexible in case he decides to take a different path."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of planning, I'm curious—have you discovered any new restaurants or local shops around here lately?",

            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear! I've been meaning to try something different.",

            "advisor_message": "Moving onto your housing expenses, Linda. I'd like to cover your mortgage payments first. Can you remind me of the details there?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for confirming that. And I see it's set as an essential expense, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right. It's our top priority until we pay it off in 2035."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, that makes sense. Now, regarding your property tax, I believe your spouse handles that?",
            "client_message": "Exactly, and it's $450 paid quarterly."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it! Would you consider this an important priority, and is it also until 2035?",
            "client_message": "Yes, it's important to us, and the timeframe matches the mortgage."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, Linda. Having both these set clearly will help your financial planning. Are there any questions or adjustments you want to discuss today?",
            "client_message": "No changes for now. Just wanted clarity, and you've helped with that!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, while crunching numbers can be pretty intense, sometimes I just need to step outside and watch the birds for a bit. Do you enjoy any local wildlife activities?",
            "client_message": "Funny you mention that! We actually have a few bird feeders in our backyard, and it’s quite calming to watch them, especially early in the morning."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds wonderful! There’s something so peaceful about it. I often find that taking a break like that can really clear the mind.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, it’s a nice way to unwind and recharge."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Mind if I ask you a few more questions about your income? It's important for us to get a clear picture for your financial plan.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great! So, let's talk about your salary. Can you confirm that your gross annual income is $75,000?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. My salary is $75,000 gross per year."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. And when you say gross, that’s before any taxes or deductions, right?",
            "client_message": "Exactly, that's before any deductions. It’s the full amount before taxes."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Just to confirm, there's no specific timeframe—like a bonus period or contract term—linked to this amount?",
            "client_message": "That's right, there's no particular timeframe. It's just my regular annual salary."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks, Linda. Understanding these details helps us tailor the plan to fit your needs. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",
            "client_message": "Thanks, Marcus. I appreciate the clarity. I'll definitely let you know if anything else comes to mind."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, Linda, the other day I was in this long queue at the supermarket. It felt like it took forever just to buy a pack of gum. Have you ever had one of those days?",
            "client_message": "Oh, absolutely! Just the other day, I spent ages looking for my keys, only to find them right in front of me. It's those little things that can really shift your whole day."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly! Those minor hiccups always seem to happen at the most inconvenient times.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To switch gears, could you elaborate on how you're currently managing your loans, Linda? I'm especially interested in any specifics like providers, rates, or outstanding amounts.",
            "client_message": "Sure, Marcus. I have a couple of ongoing commitments. I have a mortgage with Sunshine Bank. The monthly cost for that is $1500, and there’s still about $250,000 outstanding on that loan."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Alright, and do you recall the interest rate on your mortgage? Any special terms there?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, the interest rate is 3.5%. But the good news is I have a special rate of 2.5% fixed until 2029."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s a solid deal, and when does the mortgage end?",
            "client_message": "The final payment is scheduled for June 30, 2045."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, Linda. Now, let’s look at any other loans you might have. You mentioned a car loan previously?",
            "client_message": "Yes, from AutoFinance Corp. The monthly payments for that are $320, with $12,000 still outstanding."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And what's the interest rate on your car loan? Any special conditions?",
            "client_message": "It's a straightforward 4% interest rate with no special conditions. The last payment is set for March 15, 2027."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, speaking of keeping everything organized, it reminds me of my dog, Max. He's quite the planner himself in a way. Every morning, he has this funny routine where he rearranges his toys. It’s like he has his own little strategy going on.",
            "client_message": "That’s adorable! My cat, Bella, has a similar habit. She loves to line up her toy mice in a perfect row. It's quite entertaining to watch."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Pets can be so amusing with their little quirks. It’s like they have their own mini worlds to manage!",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "How about we discuss your current repayment plans? It looks like you have a few commitments that we should address.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great. Let's start with your student loan. You're paying $400 monthly, and this is an essential priority for you, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly. I’m committed to paying that amount until 2030."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. And you also have a car loan repayment. If I have this right, you're paying $270 each month for that, and it's listed as important, though not as high priority as the student loan. Does that sound correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that’s right. The car loan is important but not as critical as the student loan. It's scheduled to be fully repaid by 2025."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Sounds like you have a clear plan in place. Just to confirm, the car loan is set to be finished by 2025, so we’ll need to adjust your budget when that transitions. Are you comfortable with the current setup?",
            "client_message": "I am, Marcus. I like having a clear end date for both, and these amounts fit well into my budget for now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Excellent, Linda. Keeping everything aligned with your goals is key. If anything changes, like if you want to accelerate payments or adjust priorities, let me know, and we can revisit your strategy.",
            "client_message": "Will do. Thanks for keeping it organized, Marcus."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, while we're on the topic of subscriptions and relaxation, have you had a chance to check out any local parks or walking trails in the area? They can be a great way to unwind without any extra cost.",
            "client_message": "I have, actually! There's a lovely park nearby that I visit sometimes. It's a nice break from everything."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's wonderful to hear. It's amazing how those places can provide a bit of peace and clarity. Plus, they're often such a nice escape without impacting the budget.",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Let's pivot and discuss some of your subscription services. It looks like we have a monthly cost here for streaming services. Could you confirm the details for me?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Great, is this something you consider a discretionary expense—something you might adjust based on other financial priorities?",

        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You're right to think about it, Linda. Inflation can indeed impact premiums. Since your car insurance is an ongoing expense, it's crucial to factor that in over time. Do you plan to keep this insurance unchanged for the foreseeable future?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I don't have any plans to switch. It's important to me to keep it consistent. I've always seen it as a necessity, not something I should compromise on."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. Keeping your essential expenses like car insurance stable is wise. With it being an annual cost, have you noticed any changes year-to-year, or have they remained fairly consistent?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely. It’s about maintaining the balance in your budget. Would adjusting your insurance payments each year be a concern, or are you okay with the premiums increasing gradually as they have been?",
            "client_message": "Gradual increases are okay, as long as they don't get too steep. I'd prefer keeping the insurance ongoing rather than having to reconsider it. It's peace of mind."

        {
            "advisor_message": "It sounds like you're strategically prioritizing your essential expenses. Monitoring how they align with inflation trends will be key. Let's keep an eye on it and adjust as needed in your financial plan.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a well-organized approach. Do you see this amount changing in the near future, or is it pretty stable?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Stability is key in planning, especially when it comes to essential costs. Would you say grocery shopping is at the top of your list in terms of priority?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "Alright, let's move on to your annual professional expenses, Linda. Can we start with the conference registration fees?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, it’s interesting how we often focus so much on our plans and insurance but tend not to think about how our pets might feel about our routines. My cat, for instance, has a habit of sitting on my laptop every time I start working. It's as if he knows when I'm busy and wants all the attention himself.",
            "client_message": "That's funny! My dog does something similar. Whenever I'm in a Zoom meeting, he insists on making a cameo by barking or trying to squeeze into the frame. It's like he knows exactly when I'm not supposed to be interrupted."

            "advisor_message": "Great! Let's start with your Life Assurance policy from Sunlife Insurance. You’re paying $120.50 monthly for a $500,000 coverage. It's in trust, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that’s right. I wanted to make sure my family is covered financially if something unexpected happens to me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a solid plan. And I see it’s assured until the end of 2050, giving you long-term security. What are your main objectives with this policy?",
            "client_message": "Primarily financial security for my family. It gives me peace of mind knowing they’ll be okay."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Perfect. Now, moving on to your Income Protection with Aviva. You’re paying $75.00 monthly for a payout of $3,000 in case of illness or injury, is that accurate?",
            "client_message": "Yes, Marcus. The goal is to ensure income continuity, especially since it's not in trust. It runs right up until my retirement."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Good strategy. Last but not least, your Critical Illness Cover with Prudential costs $90.00 a month for $200,000 coverage, assured until June 2045. How does this align with your objectives?",
