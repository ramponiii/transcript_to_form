            "client_message": "Sure, James! I’ve read that good debt is like student loans or a mortgage, where it’s considered an investment in my future. On the other hand, bad debt seems to be more about things like credit card debt that doesn’t really add to my financial growth. Does that sound right?"

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s fantastic to hear! With your focus on fitness and wellness, do you anticipate any long-term care needs in the near future?",
            "client_message": "No, I’m currently independent and don’t see a need for long-term care. I’m pretty active, so I’m hoping to keep it that way!"

            "advisor_message": "With the holiday season approaching, many people start to think about travel plans. Do you have any special plans coming up?",
            "client_message": "Not this year, actually. I'm planning to enjoy a cozy holiday at home, just relaxing and maybe catching up on some reading."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about your current living arrangements, Emily?",

            "advisor_message": "Perfect, so he'll remain a dependent until June 15th, 2033. Is that right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. And then there's Liam."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Now, for Liam, could you remind me of his date of birth?",
            "client_message": "Liam was born on November 22, 2018."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks, Emily. So, Liam will be a dependent until November 22, 2036. Let's make sure these timelines are reflected in our holistic planning to cover all phases of support.",

            "client_message": "Of course, James! My monthly rent is $1,500. It's definitely one of my essential expenses."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, thank you for sharing that. It's important that we categorize it correctly. So, this $1,500 is paid monthly, correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right. It's one of those recurring monthly payments I can't really adjust."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, that makes sense. We consider this an essential expense since it's housing-related. Would you say your housing situation is stable for the foreseeable future, or are there any changes expected?",
            "client_message": "No changes expected, really. My lease is pretty solid, and I plan on staying there for the near future."
        },
        {

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, while we're on the topic of consistency, it reminds me of my cat's morning routine. Without fail, he's up at the crack of dawn, ready for breakfast. Funny how even pets have their own set routines that they stick to!",
            "client_message": "I can totally relate to that! My dog does this quirky dance every morning, just before we go for a walk. It's like he's counting down the seconds until we hit the sidewalk."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s hilarious! I bet it’s quite the sight to see first thing in the morning. Animals really do have their unique ways of making each day special, don’t they? It’s reassuring how some things remain constant, just like your stable rent and income streams.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, pets definitely add a fun element to our daily routines, just like those set expenses keep things predictably in check."

        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, and is that amount you're referring to gross or net income?",
            "client_message": "Oh, it's net. So after taxes and everything else, I get the full amount."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for clarifying. Could you tell me how much you usually take home each month from consulting?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Just to confirm, you receive this on a regular monthly basis, right?",
            "client_message": "Exactly, every month like clockwork."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. Understanding this helps us create a clear picture of your financial situation. Is there anything else notable about this income you'd like to mention?",
            "client_message": "Not really, it’s pretty straightforward. Just a consistent monthly net figure."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great to know, Emily. On a lighter note, while we’re on the topic of all things monthly and regular—ever find yourself indulging in some fresh bakery treats? I find a good loaf of sourdough or a warm croissant makes a day special.",
            "client_message": "I completely agree! There’s something about a freshly baked croissant that just feels like a luxury."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, nothing beats that! And the variety of options, from baguettes to whole grain, they all have their own charm.",
            "client_message": "You’re right, each type has its place. I do love a good multigrain when I want something hearty."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Definitely a solid choice. Okay, shifting back to our review—",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "What about your current outstanding loans and mortgage, Emily? Let's ensure we have a clear picture.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, James. I have a mortgage with Green Bank. My monthly cost there is $1200.75, and the total outstanding value is around $240,000."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. And the interest rate on that mortgage, do you have that number?",
            "client_message": "Yes, it’s 3.75%. But I have a special rate of 2.9% fixed until 2028."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, that's a good rate. And when is the final payment due?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And what's the outstanding value and the interest rate for that loan?",

            "advisor_message": "Speaking of percentages, have you been keeping up with the latest sports season? Quite a game last week, right?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Prioritizing essential payments is key. Now, what about your car loan? How does that fit into your monthly budget?",
            "client_message": "My car loan is another significant one. I pay $350 monthly, and it’s important as I rely on my car for work. This will go on until 2025."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks for sharing that, Emily. It’s helpful to align these payments with your financial goals.",
