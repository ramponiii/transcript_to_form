        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s excellent to hear. Now, on a related note, do you foresee any potential need for long-term care or have any family history that would make it a consideration?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's really good that you’ve taken that step. As part of your estate planning, do you have a power of attorney, and who is responsible for it?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s great, Emily. So, switching topics briefly, do you have a favorite type of bread or pastry? I know a lot of people find fresh-baked goods hard to resist.",
            "client_message": "Oh, I absolutely love sourdough bread. The crust and the tangy flavor are just perfect. How about you?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I’m partial to a good croissant. Something about the buttery layers just makes it such a delightful treat.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I know, right? It seems like that's all anyone can talk about these days! It's fun to have a little escape with all these financial discussions.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "As we look at their dependency timelines, I need to let you know we're adjusting our projections due to some new financial guidelines. For Lucas, we had planned for him to be dependent until May 15, 2033.",
            "client_message": "Okay, I remember us talking about that timeline. Is something changing for Lucas?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Not for Lucas specifically. The timeline of May 15, 2033, still stands for him, given he was born on May 15, 2015. However, these updates affect our budgeting strategies for his future needs.",
            "client_message": "I see. So, it's more about how we financially plan for him. What about Sofia? Is there anything I need to know regarding her timeline?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Sofia's situation is similar. She was born on August 27, 2018, and we currently plan for her to be dependent until August 27, 2036. The strategy adjustments apply to both but mainly involve ensuring adequate resources for their education and other future goals.",
            "client_message": "Got it. I want to make sure we’re making smart moves so they have a secure future. It sounds like there's a lot to consider!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly, Emily. While these guideline changes might seem a bit daunting, with some tailored adjustments, we can maintain a strong strategy for both Lucas and Sofia’s support up to their respective dependent dates. Let's keep exploring options that align with your aspirations for them.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Speaking of strategizing, it's a bit like waiting in line at a coffee shop sometimes, isn't it? It can feel endless, but once you're there, you get exactly what you need.",
            "client_message": "I know what you mean! It's like when I misplace my keys right before leaving the house, such a small thing but seems to throw off the whole morning."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly, those little hiccups can add up! It's all about keeping things on track despite the small detours.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Now, regarding some of your current expenses, let's dive into the housing-related ones. I see that your rent payment is $1,500 monthly, and it's noted as an essential expense. Is that information still correct?",
            "client_message": "Yes, exactly! It's definitely one of those non-negotiable expenses for me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, rent tends to be the cornerstone of our monthly budgeting, similar to the king in a chess game—everything revolves around it. Now, you also have a home insurance premium of $120 monthly. It seems to be categorized as important, which makes sense. Is there a specific reason you've prioritized it until 2025?",
            "client_message": "Right, the home insurance is important to me because it provides peace of mind. I've planned to keep it until 2025 since my lease ends around then. After that, I might reconsider depending on my situation."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a well-thought-out plan. Ensuring you're covered up through your current lease is strategic. Given recent global events, such as economic uncertainties, are there any adjustments you're considering for these housing expenses?",
            "client_message": "I've been thinking about it, especially with how things are changing globally. But right now, the rent and insurance are setup I feel pretty secure with."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's key to have those essential expenses locked down, especially during unpredictable times. If anything changes, let me know. We'll make necessary adjustments to align with any new circumstances that might arise.",
            "client_message": "Thanks, I appreciate having a plan that feels solid yet adaptable. I might have more questions as things develop worldwide, but I feel good about where we are now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm glad to hear that. Remember, we're here to maneuver through these changes together. Having both fixed and flexible strategies is the essence of good financial planning, just like balancing a chessboard.",

        },

            "advisor_message": "That sounds wonderful! Growing your own herbs can also be a great money-saver in the long run.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Definitely, and it adds a personal touch to your meals. Plus, if you ever decide to do a little home improvement, those projects can be just as fulfilling.",

            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, those ongoing earnings provide a nice supplement. Are you planning to expand your course offerings, or is this something you want to keep as is for now?",

            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a smart move. Growing that side of your income could really enhance your overall financial picture. Do you see these income sources changing in the near future?",
