        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Impressive! A good sauce makes all the difference. Did you find a special recipe or did you wing it?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's the best when a new recipe goes well. Did your family enjoy it as much as you did?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Just to confirm, Emily was born on July 15, 2015, right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. Can't believe she's already eight years old!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Time flies! She will be dependent until she turns 18, so around July 15, 2033, is that what you have in mind as well?",
            "client_message": "Exactly. That's when we hope she'll be on her own, maybe heading to college or starting her career."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great. Knowing those details helps us plan for education savings and future security. Is there anything specific you want to focus on concerning her future?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Having these regular expenses mapped out is crucial. Are there any other housing expenses we haven't covered yet?",
            "client_message": "No, those two are the big ones – the mortgage payment and the property taxes. I think that's it for now."
        },
