        },

            "advisor_message": "Dogs can be such a joy. What kind of antics does Max get up to?",

            "advisor_message": "Thanks for sharing that. Now, I see here that you mentioned you're a smoker. How does that factor into your daily routine?",
            "client_message": "Yeah, I've been smoking since I was 25. I try to keep it in check to about five cigarettes per day."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I appreciate your honesty, Tom. It sounds like you're managing quite well considering these factors. Have you thought about long-term care needs, or is that something you've addressed?",
            "client_message": "At this point, I don't think long-term care is needed. I'm pretty independent and keep up with regular check-ups."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. And just to make sure we're on the same page, do you have a will and any power of attorney set up?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I have a will that I created back in 2018, and it's with my family attorney. But I don't have a power of attorney in place right now."

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds wonderful! Gardening can be so rewarding. Are you adding new plants or focusing on something else in your garden?",
            "client_message": "I'm thinking of adding some new perennials and maybe a little herb section. Keeps things fresh and lively."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a great plan. Fresh herbs can really add a lovely touch to home-cooked meals. Are you doing any other projects around the house?",
            "client_message": "Not right now, but the garden is my main focus. Might tackle some painting indoors next."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Moving onto your current address details, Tom. Let's make sure we have everything correctly documented.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. Just to complete the details, the postcode is NE1 6EE, if I'm recalling correctly?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And you moved in on June 15th, 2010?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. It's been a while now!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Have you had any exciting trips lately, Tom? It's nice to escape the everyday routine once in a while.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds lovely. It's always refreshing to have a change of scenery. Any destinations on your bucket list for the future?",
            "client_message": "We’re thinking about exploring some new places when things settle down. Perhaps somewhere with a nice blend of culture and relaxation."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Sounds like a wonderful plan. There's nothing like a well-rounded vacation to recharge. Speaking of which, let's dive back into our conversation.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Next, I'd like to explore your dependents, Tom. Could you tell me more about Sophie and Max?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Amanda. Sophie was born on April 15, 2015, and Max was born on September 23, 2017."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, thank you. So, considering their birthdates, Sophie will be dependent until she’s about 21, which would be April 15, 2036. Max, then, would remain dependent until around September 23, 2038. Does that sound about right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that aligns with what we were planning. It makes sense for them to be covered until they finish their education."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely. Ensuring their financial support is in place until at least those dates will give you peace of mind. Are there any specific goals or concerns you have for their financial future as we plan for those timelines?",
            "client_message": "We definitely want to make sure college expenses are covered, and perhaps a little extra for their first steps into the workforce."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s great thinking, Tom. As we develop a plan, we'll focus on those educational funds and perhaps also consider some options for long-term savings or investments to support their early career years.",
            "client_message": "That sounds good to me, Amanda. I really appreciate your help in organizing this."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It’s my pleasure, Tom. With a solid plan, we'll make sure Sophie and Max have a strong financial foundation. Shall we look at some investment options next time?",
            "client_message": "Yes, let's do that. I think it would be a good next step."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Before we dive into your housing expenses, let me share a quick tip that might help streamline your day-to-day life a bit. Have you thought about organizing your household items to make everything run a bit smoother? It can be surprisingly effective to declutter just a little.",
            "client_message": "Funny you should mention that, Amanda. We actually started tidying up some rooms last weekend, and it's already making a difference."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s fantastic! Sometimes even small efforts in decluttering can create a clearer, more organized space which might help in other areas too.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s definitely a significant expense. And how long do you anticipate making these monthly payments?",
            "client_message": "The plan is to continue them until 2040. So I've got a bit of a journey ahead!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thank you for sharing those important details. It's essential to have a clear view of these essential expenses in your financial plan.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s wonderful! Do you have any favorite authors or genres you gravitate towards?",
            "client_message": "I enjoy a mix, but I’ve always been a fan of mystery novels."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "There’s something captivating about solving a puzzle through a good story, isn't there? Is there a particular author you enjoy?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, and I really enjoy Agatha Christie’s works. They're classics for a reason."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Christie's ability to weave intricate stories is truly remarkable. It's like financial planning – piecing everything together meticulously.",

        },

            "advisor_message": "And how long do you plan to continue with the consulting?",

        },

            "advisor_message": "That makes sense. There's something about a morning coffee that just sets the day off right. What about Emily? Does she share your coffee enthusiasm, or is she into tea?",
