            "advisor_message": "I'm glad to hear everything's up to date. You know, while we're sorting through details, it's always a good idea to periodically declutter at home. How do you usually tackle organizing your household items, Melissa? Any tips you've found helpful?",
            "client_message": "Well, I try to keep things simple by using the one-in, one-out rule. When I buy something new, I make it a point to donate or recycle an item I don't use anymore. It helps me maintain a tidy space."

            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a solid approach. Migraines can be a bit of a challenge. Are you currently a smoker, or have you smoked in the past?",
            "client_message": "No, I’ve never been a smoker. I've always stayed away from cigarettes."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's excellent to hear you're maintaining such a healthy lifestyle. Given your current state of health, do you anticipate any need for long-term care in the future?",

            "advisor_message": "That's a solid timeline. Since Ethan is a dependent until July 15, 2030, have you thought about how his needs might evolve over the years?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I'm thinking about his education and any unexpected expenses. I want to ensure we're prepared, but I'm not entirely sure about the best way to plan financially for those years."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's great to be proactive. While considering investments, I'd advise caution with high-risk options. Consistent savings and low-risk investments might be more suitable given the timeframe and goals you’re set on.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. We can map out a strategy that aligns with that, ensuring Ethan’s needs are met sustainably. Do you have any more questions or should we dive into the specifics of planning?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, talking about mortgages and budgets reminds me of when I was a kid. I used to have a piggy bank shaped like a little house. It was one of those things where you'd save and dream of the kind of home you'd have in the future.",
            "client_message": "That's a nice memory! I remember saving up coins in a jar for a toy I really wanted. Funny how those small lessons about saving stick with us, right?"
