            "client_message": "Oh, definitely! One memory that always brings a smile to my face is when I was about six years old, and I got to help my grandfather plant a tiny apple tree in his backyard. It was such a small thing, but watching it grow over the years has been pretty special to me."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Got it, Evelyn. And your pronouns are she/her, correct?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's explore your current health situation and any plans you might have in place that relate to that. How are things on the health front, Evelyn?",
            "client_message": "I’d say my health is generally good! I do have occasional stress-related migraines, but I try to manage them with regular exercise and a balanced diet."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It’s great to hear that you’re taking a proactive approach. Managing stress can be really important. Do you smoke at all?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s always a positive note. Have you considered any long-term care options, or do you feel that's not necessary at the moment?",
            "client_message": "I don’t think I need long-term care right now. I feel like I’m in a good place health-wise."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And what about your legal documents, like a will or power of attorney? Have you set those in order?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I have a will. It was created in 2021 and my attorney James Mitchell has it. Also, my sister Anna holds the power of attorney."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, it sounds like you have a solid foundation set up. Trust is crucial with these matters, and having Anna nearby must bring peace of mind.",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, I trust her completely. It feels good to have support and clear plans in place."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s wonderful. You know, talking about the support you mentioned with your sister reminds me of my own childhood. My siblings and I used to....",
            "client_message": "...spend hours playing in our backyard, pretending it was a vast jungle. It's funny how those little adventures stay with you, isn’t it?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, such memories have a special place in our hearts. Alright, shifting gears a bit, I'd like to ask about your current and previous living situations, to make sure everything's clear for our planning.",
            "client_message": "Oh sure, sounds good! What do you need to know?"
        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, let's start with your current address. I see you're renting a place now. Can you confirm this is at 15 Queen's Gardens in London, with the postcode SW1A 1AA?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's right! I moved in around mid-June 2021."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect, and Queen's Gardens is a lovely area. Now, about your previous address. You owned a place in Canary Wharf, correct? It was Flat 21, postcode E14 5AB.",
            "client_message": "Yes, I bought that flat back in April 2018."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And just to clarify, you moved from Canary Wharf to your current rented place in 2021, right?",
            "client_message": "Exactly! I needed a change and Canary Wharf was getting too hectic for me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Understood. So both addresses are in London, and you're in Greater London for the county. Does that sound right?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's it. All in good old London!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "London weather can be quite unpredictable at times. Do you find it affects your outdoor plans often?",
            "client_message": "Oh, definitely. It tends to rain when we least expect it, so we're always ready to switch plans."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's the London charm, isn't it? Keeping an umbrella handy is a must. Do you find the kids ever get restless with frequent indoor days?",
            "client_message": "Yes, especially during the rainy spells. We try to keep them entertained with indoor activities, but it's not the same as being outside."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I can imagine. It's nice when there's a sunny weekend. Do you have any favorite spots you like to take them to when the weather cooperates?",
            "client_message": "We love spending time at the local parks. Hyde Park is a favorite for a good stretch and some fresh air."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about your dependents? I'm interested in understanding more about their needs and timelines.",
            "client_message": "Sure, I have two children. My son, James Harper, was born on April 15, 2010."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, so that means James will be dependent until he's about 18, right? So we’re looking at a timeframe up to April 15, 2028.",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's correct. By then, he should be finishing high school."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And your daughter, could you tell me about her?",
            "client_message": "Of course, my daughter is Sophia Harper. She was born on July 22, 2015."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Thanks, Evelyn. So if we assume dependency until she's around 18, Sophia would be reliant until roughly July 22, 2033.",
            "client_message": "Exactly. That gives us a bit more time to plan for her compared to James."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "This information is really helpful. It gives us a solid foundation for planning their future needs and aligning them with your financial goals. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss in relation to their long-term plans?",
            "client_message": "Nothing specific right now, but I’m interested in making sure we have enough set aside for their education."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "You know, while we’re on the topic of planning ahead, it's kind of like keeping an eye on your favorite sports team, isn't it? Planning season by season.",
            "client_message": "That's a good way to look at it! I try to follow the local teams when I can."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Yes, there's always that anticipation, balancing wins and setbacks.",
            "client_message": "Exactly, each season has its ups and downs. Kind of like planning for the future!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm curious to hear more about your current housing situation, Evelyn. How's everything going on that front?",
            "client_message": "Oh, it's pretty straightforward. I have a nice little apartment that I really like. The rent is $1,200 a month, which is manageable."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a cozy setup. Is this an essential part of your monthly budget then?",
            "client_message": "Definitely! I consider it essential. Keeping that roof over my head is a top priority for sure."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And you said it's $1,200. That must be on a monthly schedule, right?",
            "client_message": "Yep, it's monthly. Keeps me on my toes, making sure everything is paid on time."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Are there any plans or timeframes for change, or is this arrangement pretty stable for now?",
            "client_message": "For now, it’s stable. No immediate plans to change anything, just focusing on maintaining what I've got."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great to hear that it's all working well for you. Do you have any questions or concerns about future housing plans or possible changes down the line?",
            "client_message": "Not at the moment. I'm just taking it as it comes, but I'll definitely let you know if anything pops up!"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "By the way, have you ever spent way too much time in a queue at the store? It's like, the line never moves and suddenly time seems to stop.",
            "client_message": "Oh, tell me about it! I once waited half an hour just to buy a couple of items. It's like everyone decided to do their shopping at the exact same time."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And then there's always that one person who can't find their wallet, right?",
            "client_message": "Exactly! Or when someone realizes they forgot an item and leaves to get it, holding everyone up. It's a little frustrating, but what can you do, right?"
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I'm curious to hear more about your freelance graphic design work, Evelyn. How's everything going on that front?",
            "client_message": "Oh, it's going really well! It's definitely a passion of mine. I'm working as a freelance graphic designer right now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds fantastic! Do you mind sharing how much you're currently making from your freelance work each month?",
            "client_message": "Sure, I bring in about $4,500 monthly from my graphic design projects. It's all net, so after taxes and expenses."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's great to hear. Having a reliable net income each month can really help with financial planning. Is this income consistent, or does it fluctuate?",
            "client_message": "It's pretty consistent. I have a steady stream of clients right now, which helps keep things predictable."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's definitely a bonus. Since it's net income, have you been thinking about any particular goals you'd like to achieve with your earnings?",
            "client_message": "Honestly, I'm just looking to ensure I set myself up for a secure future. I like to keep my options open and plan long-term."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a very sensible approach. We can look into some strategies to make your income work harder for you while maintaining that flexibility. Sound good?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Before we dive deeper into your financial details, are there any areas at home where you feel you could make a few adjustments or improvements? Sometimes organizing or decluttering can give a sense of clarity that might even translate to financial planning.",
            "client_message": "Actually, I've been meaning to tackle my workspace. It's my creative hub, but it could use some decluttering."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a great place to start. A well-organized workspace can boost productivity and even make financial tasks feel less daunting.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about any loans or mortgages you currently have, Evelyn?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Marcus! I have a mortgage with Sunrise Lending Group. It’s a pretty hefty one, with an outstanding value of $250,000. I'm paying $1,200 a month, but at least the interest rate is fixed at 2.8% until 2028. After that, it'll be at 3.5%."

        {
            "advisor_message": "A fixed rate is nice for stability. And how long is the mortgage term?",
            "client_message": "It's set to be fully paid off by July 1st, 2048. Still some years to go! But it feels good to have a plan in place."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's a solid setup. Do you have any other loans you’re managing alongside this?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I have car finance with Green Wheels Finance. The monthly payment is $300, and there's $15,000 left to pay. It's at 5.6% interest, but I did get an introductory rate of 4.5% for the first year."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Ah, the introductory rates can be quite a draw. And when is that schedule to be cleared?",
            "client_message": "The final payment is due on December 15th, 2026. So there's not too long to go on that one."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Good to know. Anything else on your financial landscape we should discuss?",
            "client_message": "Well, I also have a personal loan from Liberty Bank. I pay $450 each month for that, with an outstanding amount of $10,000 at an interest rate of 7.2%. It’s due to be finished by March 10th, 2025."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Have you ever had to make adjustments to your budget because of unforeseen expenses, like fluctuating gas prices or anything?",
            "client_message": "Oh, for sure. Actually, that often makes me consider alternatives, like using public transportation. It's sometimes more affordable and predictable."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Public transportation can really be a great option for saving on costs. Do you have good access to it in your area?",
            "client_message": "Yes, thankfully. I live near a few major bus routes that help me get around without too much hassle."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Next, I'd like to explore your student loan situation a bit more. Can you tell me how you're managing the payments?",

        },
