        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds delightful! There's nothing like a home-cooked meal to bring a bit of comfort and joy. Did you make the pasta from scratch?",
            "client_message": "We did think about making the pasta ourselves, but opted for store-bought this time. Maybe next time we'll give it a try."

            "client_message": "I’m generally healthy, though I do have some minor issues. Mainly, I deal with occasional migraines, but otherwise, I’m in good shape."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Got it. Since health and future planning go hand in hand, do you have a will in place?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I do. My will is located with my attorney, and I last updated it in 2022."
        },

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's pivot and discuss your current living arrangements, Alex. Can you confirm the details of your rental property in London?",
            "client_message": "Sure, Jordan. I’m currently renting a place at 22B Baker Street, in London. The postcode is SW1A 1AA, and I've been living here since May 15, 2021."

            "client_message": "Yes, I did own a place there. The address was 15 Princes Street, Edinburgh, with the postcode EH3 9EP."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "And you moved in there on April 10, 2018, is that correct?",
            "client_message": "Exactly. I lived there before moving to London."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Perfect. It's helpful to have this timeline and address history as we look into the right strategies for you. Is there anything else about these properties you'd like to discuss?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's interesting how life circumstances can shift our priorities. Do you find that your financial planning changes have impacted your hobbies or interests over the years, Alex?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, Jordan. I used to spend a lot of time on photography, but as my financial focus shifted, that hobby took a backseat. It’s still a passion of mine, just less of a priority right now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I understand that. Hobbies often reflect where we are in life. Have you found new activities that fit better with your current situation?",
            "client_message": "Yes, in a way. I’ve become more interested in activities that the whole family can participate in, like hiking or biking. It’s a way to stay active and spend quality time together."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That sounds like a wonderful way to balance personal fulfillment with family engagement. It's important that our personal growth and family well-being evolve together over time.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I see you have Jamie Taylor listed as a dependent. They were born on April 14, 2012, and will be dependent until April 14, 2030. Let's make sure we're planning with that timeframe in mind.",
            "client_message": "Yes, that's Jamie. It makes sense to take those dates into account when we're planning for their future needs."
        },

            "advisor_message": "Great. Now for Sam Taylor, born on November 22, 2015. According to the records, they'll be dependent until November 22, 2033. Does that match your expectations?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, that's correct for Sam. It's vital to consider how these timelines coincide with other financial goals."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Exactly, Alex. Balancing these timelines with good debt, like a mortgage that builds equity, versus bad debt, such as credit card debt, is key for long-term stability. How do you currently view and manage these types of debts?",
            "client_message": "I try to leverage good debt where possible, like our mortgage, and keep bad debt to a minimum. It’s important to me to understand which practices align with a secure future for my family."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That’s a sound approach. Planning with the end dates for Jamie and Sam’s dependency in mind helps us ensure resources are available for their education and other expenses without accruing high-interest debt.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "I've recently been experimenting with different types of coffee at home. Do you enjoy coffee or perhaps have a favorite tea?",
            "client_message": "I do enjoy both, actually! I’m always on the lookout for a good coffee blend or a soothing herbal tea."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "There's something about trying out a new coffee blend that can be quite refreshing, wouldn’t you agree?",
            "client_message": "Absolutely, although sometimes I prefer a simple chamomile tea to unwind at the end of the day."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "A chamomile tea can be really calming. It seems like you have a good balance between both worlds.",
            "client_message": "For sure. I think having that balance helps keep things interesting and enjoyable day-to-day."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Alright, let's move on to discuss some essential aspects of your financial plan. How about we start with your recurring expenses? Could you share some details on those?",
            "client_message": "Sure, I have a couple of regular expenses related to housing that are pretty important."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Great, let's take a look. Can you tell me about your rent payment?",
            "client_message": "Of course. I pay $1,500 on a monthly basis for rent. It's definitely an essential expense for me, as it's ongoing with no foreseeable changes for now."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Got it. Rent is indeed a crucial part of our budgeting. Do you have any other ongoing housing-related expenses?",
            "client_message": "Yes, I spend about $200 each month on home maintenance. While it's not as critical as my rent, it's still pretty important to me."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Absolutely, ongoing home maintenance is key to preserving your home's condition and preventing more costly repairs in the future. Both these expenses are consistently part of your monthly budget, correct?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "That's wise, managing these well ensures stability in your financial situation. Given the importance of these expenses, it might be beneficial to discuss an emergency fund to cover unexpected costs. How do you feel about exploring that next?",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's nice to see you have that additional stream. Is this consulting something you plan to continue long-term, or do you see an endpoint for it?",
            "client_message": "I'll be doing it until 2025. It's a nice supplement to my salary, but I don't see it as a permanent fixture in my income."

            "advisor_message": "Got it. Now, regarding early withdrawal penalties, are there concerns about withdrawing from certain accounts that might impact you?",

            "advisor_message": "That's an important consideration. We can definitely look into how your salary and freelance work might influence decisions around withdrawals and penalties.

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Right, that's a good rate to lock in for the next few years. And when is the final payment due on the mortgage?",
