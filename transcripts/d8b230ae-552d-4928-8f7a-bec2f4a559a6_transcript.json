            "advisor_message": "To shift our focus slightly, can you tell me about your current state of health, David?",
            "client_message": "Of course, Rachel. I'm generally healthy, though I do manage some mild hypertension with medication. I lead a healthy lifestyle otherwise."
        },

            "client_message": "Yes, that’s partly why I decided against accelerating the payments right now. I want to ensure I have the resources to invest in other areas without stretching myself too thin."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "It's important to consider how managing your finances effectively can sometimes be similar to tending a garden. You nurture different areas to ensure everything flourishes as intended.",

        {
            "advisor_message": "Definitely. It's like making adjustments along the way, as you'd do when putting in a new feature in your garden or home. Sometimes patience and timing are everything.",
            "client_message": "Right, and having a plan helps guide those steps, ensuring everything lines up with my long-term goals."
        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "To switch gears, could you elaborate on your current income sources? This will help us get a clear picture of your financial landscape.",

        },
        {
            "advisor_message": "Sounds about right. And the interest rate you’re dealing with at the moment, is it a standard rate?",
            "client_message": "I’m currently on a 3.5% rate, but there's a special deal: 2.8% fixed until 2028."
