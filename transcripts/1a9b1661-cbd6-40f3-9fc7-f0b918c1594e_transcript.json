            "client_message": "Yes, that's exactly right! It's amazing to see how much it's appreciated. I love collecting art, so it's great knowing it’s a good investment too."

        {
            "advisor_message": "Let's delve a bit deeper into your professional expenses, Emily. It's essential to understand the specifics to help align them with your financial goals. Shall we start with the software licensing fee?",
