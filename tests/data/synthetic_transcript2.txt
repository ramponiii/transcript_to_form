ADVISOR:
0:00:02
All right, Samuel.
0:00:03
So let me introduce myself first of all, because I thought you were going to mostly speak.
0:00:09
So I’m Juliet Simpson.
0:00:11
I do some French for 12 years.
0:00:13
Yeah, I’m a financial advisor at ACME Wealth Strategies. Yeah, we—
0:00:20
I live in Asheville, NC.
0:00:21
We have an office in Hendersonville, NC.
0:00:23
We do 401(k)s, investments, savings, reverse‑mortgage planning, estate planning, tax planning, all of this.
0:00:28
I personally don’t do mortgage advice, but we have someone in‑house who does that. Yeah.
0:00:34
And I used to be in investment banking, so I’m quite into investment also.
0:00:41
I used to be higher on earth, which—when I saw your request—I said, well, I can help you with that. So…
0:00:49
So tell me about you, Samuel.

CLIENT:
0:00:51
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. So—
0:00:54
So commercial finance director at Sunrise Assisted Living over in Mapleton, NC.
0:01:02
So, as you see, two—two young children.

ADVISOR:
0:01:06
And how old is he?

CLIENT:
0:01:08
Well, Maylee is going to be three—yeah—next week.
0:01:13
And then Lylee is about—
0:01:15
She’s about 18 months now.

ADVISOR:
0:01:16
Well, you are exactly like my kids.
0:01:18
Yeah, I’m exactly like you.

CLIENT:
0:01:20
Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:01:20
She—
0:01:21
Rosie is April 23rd, and Marvin is 18 months next month.

CLIENT:
0:01:26
Okay. Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:01:27
So we are in—

CLIENT:
0:01:28
The same boat? Yes, yes.

ADVISOR:
0:01:30
How are they doing?

CLIENT:
0:01:31
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
0:01:32
I think they’re just full of cold at the moment and everything else that comes with it. Yes, it’s—

ADVISOR:
0:01:37
I feel it’s only November, but I feel we’ve been in it for four weeks.
0:01:41
But I had a run at the day‑care because last time I picked them up they didn’t even have a sweater.
0:01:44
And I’m like, you don’t wake up in the night—
0:01:47
I want a sweater on all the time.
0:01:49
Yeah, it’s 41 degrees.

CLIENT:
0:01:50
Oh yeah.
0:01:51
My—yeah—my, my oldest, she got a really bad cough at the moment.
0:01:54
So she just basically ends up in the middle of our bed all the time.
0:01:57
And so you—

ADVISOR:
0:01:58
Say that—this is exactly what’s happening.
0:02:01
Yesterday night was the first night when actually it was just me and my husband.
0:02:04
But otherwise we had, like, four nights where—
0:02:07
And then she just comes up and just crashes, and I’m like, I’m not going to fight this one.
0:02:12
It just goes ahead.

CLIENT:
0:02:14
But—but yeah.
0:02:15
So obviously—yeah—very busy life.
0:02:17
My partner works full‑time as well. Okay.
0:02:21
So I think—from my kind of side of things—
0:02:23
So financial advice‑wise.
0:02:25
So I like to think I’m pretty savvy when it comes to finances.
0:02:29
So very good with savings and pensions.

ADVISOR:
0:02:32
So how old are you—

CLIENT:
0:02:33
So 31.

ADVISOR:
0:02:34
Okay.

CLIENT:
0:02:36
31.
0:02:37
So I think—from my side of things—kinda looking for advice, obviously, as you mentioned, about the high‑earner side of things.

ADVISOR:
0:02:43
So I just—

CLIENT:
0:02:44
Kinda at that point.
0:02:45
So current salary—car allowance—about $165 000.
0:02:50
And then a bonus as well.
0:02:52
So I think this year it’ll be about $20 K because I’ve only been there for half of the year, but on average about $39 000 a year.
0:03:00
That’s most of the time.
0:03:02
So kinda in that place at the moment now where I’ve got two young children in child‑care.
0:03:07
Obviously using the—you get the government help.
0:03:11
We’re obviously paying for child‑care and that, and—and I know once you go over that kind of $150 000 threshold, you—you lose all the free hours and—and all the other benefits that come with it.

ADVISOR:
0:03:21
And so that is included in the $165 K or not?

CLIENT:
0:03:25
Yeah.
0:03:25
It’s included in that.

ADVISOR:
0:03:28
Yeah.
0:03:28
She goes to day‑care.
0:03:30
And your wife is lower than that at least?

CLIENT:
0:03:34
Yeah.
0:03:34
She’s on about $78 000 a year.

ADVISOR:
0:03:37
So—it’s—you kinda need to look at it. Yeah.
0:03:41
How much do you put in your 401(k)—

CLIENT:
0:03:44
So at the moment—
0:03:45
So I’d probably say very little.
0:03:48
So I’ve only just started where I’m working at the moment.
0:03:51
So—so it’s BrightPath BrightPath Workplace 401(k) at the moment,
0:03:54
so it’s not really great at the moment.
0:03:56
So I’m very much taking—I’m probably putting the bare minimum into about 3 percent of that to obviously match the employer’s contributions.
0:04:04
But what—very much—I know I’m gonna be in a position where I probably need to open up, maybe a Traditional IRA, somebody actually I want to be with, and to probably put the additional income in, rather—

ADVISOR:
0:04:13
Than what—you can see—with your workplace 401(k), you can increase this.

CLIENT:
0:04:16
Yeah, I did the—

ADVISOR:
0:04:18
Only thing is how it’s invested. Yeah.
0:04:22
Full 401(k) doesn’t have a lot of choice of funds—
0:04:25
are really an employer‑based company. Yeah.
0:04:28
We can have a look. Yeah.
0:04:31
You definitely need to put a lot more into your 401(k).
0:04:32
But my question is, how much do you have left at the end of the month—now—you still have—
0:04:37
Are you able to afford to—to put more into your 401(k)? Yeah.

CLIENT:
0:04:39
Yeah of course.
0:04:39
So I think—just info—
0:04:41
So our—both our earnings, after paying child‑care and everything else like that,
0:04:45
we probably have about $3 900 left over a month.

ADVISOR:
0:04:50
So how sorry.
0:04:51
I hope you don’t mind me asking her total expenses for this household day‑care. Everything included.
0:04:57
How much do you spend?

CLIENT:
0:04:58
So I’d say between.
0:04:59
So total expenses. House?
0:05:02
Probably about $3,000 a month.
0:05:05
More for the mortgage.
0:05:08
Kids childcare is about $2,000 a month.
0:05:11
And then obviously all the different expenses and all that.
0:05:13
So I think you’d probably say about $6,500 a.

ADVISOR:
0:05:19
Year.
0:05:19
So he goes quicker.

CLIENT:
0:05:20
Yeah.
0:05:22
And I guess just otherwise.
0:05:24
So where I was previously before J and R Apparel.
0:05:27
So I had I was with your direct.

ADVISOR:
0:05:29
Yeah.

CLIENT:
0:05:30
Yeah yeah yeah.
0:05:33
Do you know somebody who works.

ADVISOR:
0:05:34
Yeah.
0:05:34
I have two clients who work there.

CLIENT:
0:05:36
Okay. They’re based.

ADVISOR:
0:05:40
In Polk County.

CLIENT:
0:05:41
Yeah. Yeah, indeed. Yeah.
0:05:42
So I was there for four years.
0:05:44
So their director there, are they? No.

ADVISOR:
0:05:46
No, if I’m honest, there are.
0:05:48
One is reduced.
0:05:49
She’s a lot older than they are.
0:05:51
Like 61 is he’s in the sales side or something like that, but she’s more in the admin side. Okay. Not management.

CLIENT:
0:05:58
Yeah. Okay.

ADVISOR:
0:05:59
But how long have you been at this care home?

CLIENT:
0:06:02
So I’ve been there about five months now. Okay. Yes. So?
0:06:06
So previously when I was with J&R, I was there for four years, so I put quite a lot of money into my pension there.
0:06:12
So that was with Vanguard Solo 401(k). Yes.
0:06:14
And obviously they had a lot more funds available.
0:06:17
And so I’ve kind of only just started being enrolled on the company pension scheme where I work now.
0:06:23
But I’m kind of looking at do I put more on my employer’s pension or do I find a better fund?
0:06:27
Yeah, I’d like to put that.

ADVISOR:
0:06:29
Can I can help you a bit for that.
0:06:31
There’s only do you do pre‑tax 401(k) deferral or is it only a voluntary like a normal automatic enro.

CLIENT:
0:06:40
Not a normal automatic enrollment.
0:06:42
At the moment we are exploring pre‑tax deferral.
0:06:45
At the moment.

ADVISOR:
0:06:46
The company is exploring.

CLIENT:
0:06:47
Yeah.
0:06:47
Yeah, we are exploring at the moment.

ADVISOR:
0:06:51
And so do you have two parts right now to do you have two pensions then or have you moved anything.

CLIENT:
0:06:57
Yeah.
0:06:57
So two pensions at the moment.

ADVISOR:
0:07:02
Okay. So up.
0:07:04
How much are they. Which part.
0:07:06
More or less.
0:07:07
Well I mean I guess the five months is small.

CLIENT:
0:07:08
But yeah, small.
0:07:09
So probably a $500 in BrightPath Workplace 401(k) and then in Vanguard Solo 401(k) would be close to about $58,500 in there good.

ADVISOR:
0:07:21
In savings wise what do you have investment account 529.

CLIENT:
0:07:25
Yeah.
0:07:25
So max out our brokerage allowance both of us.
0:07:30
So I obviously put some into my partners.
0:07:32
So total savings wise I would say about $156,000 at the moment.

ADVISOR:
0:07:40
And you have 529.

CLIENT:
0:07:41
We don’t have a 529 at the moment.
0:07:43
No I was I was I’ve always been conscious of that because it locks the money away doesn’t it, into a 529.

ADVISOR:
0:07:49
So you can they won’t they won’t be able to touch it until 18 years old. But you.

CLIENT:
0:07:55
Can still.

ADVISOR:
0:07:56
Access the money.
0:07:57
It’s per year.

CLIENT:
0:07:58
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

ADVISOR:
0:08:00
It goes quick.
0:08:00
You just put one on the palm.
0:08:01
Palm up, for example. Or you.
0:08:03
I like a monthly contributions because it helps with the average cost when you buy something. Yeah.
0:08:07
But that’s what we do with ours.
0:08:09
And they have I don’t know.
0:08:10
Each is worth about $6,500.
0:08:12
So it goes quick.

CLIENT:
0:08:13
Yeah.
0:08:13
I think we find that so.

ADVISOR:
0:08:15
Especially if you have maxed your allowance.

CLIENT:
0:08:16
Yeah, yeah.
0:08:17
So what happens is I tend to get a bonus a lot and then or something.
0:08:20
And I give them some money towards it.
0:08:22
And I was getting to that point where maxing out the, the $30,000 each. Yes. Allowance.
0:08:29
So yeah it probably need something to put in extra.
0:08:31
I was originally going to go to like Series I Savings Bonds or something like that, but I didn’t realise because I thought the 529 locked it away.

ADVISOR:
0:08:37
You as a guardian you’re going to be able to do anything.
0:08:40
What it means is they won’t be able to touch that money until they are 18.
0:08:43
So it’s quite a good, if you want to imagine, I don’t know, like you want to pay for school before.
0:08:49
I don’t know.
0:08:49
Is there anything you can take the money?
0:08:51
It’s not luck. Okay.
0:08:52
So who are you with for your high‑yield savings account?

CLIENT:
0:08:54
Who are you with?
0:08:54
So it’s with Ally Bank High‑Yield Savings.

ADVISOR:
0:08:56
Oh, yes.
0:08:57
And so is it, like a lifestyle type of investment, or do you manage your own investment?

CLIENT:
0:09:02
It’s a lifestyle investment. So?
0:09:03
So what we’ve got is so just from memory.
0:09:06
So what I’ve got is I’ve probably got about $130,000 of it just sat in high‑yield savings accounts because at the moment it’s getting about 5%.
0:09:14
It was getting about 5% interest.
0:09:16
And I’ve got I’ve just moved about $26,000 of it into just a normal investment fund.
0:09:20
So yeah, you don’t.

ADVISOR:
0:09:21
Want to start to invest it.
0:09:22
That’s a lot of cash. Yeah.

CLIENT:
0:09:24
I mean I’ve always been in that kind of thing where I was sat there in that balanced view of life where.
0:09:28
So originally probably about until about three months ago, it was mostly in cash because I was getting 5% interest on it.
0:09:36
But kind of in that place now where obviously the saving rates are coming down, where I’m trying to start investing a little bit more, but I’m trying to balance it, trying to keep about I.

ADVISOR:
0:09:44
Can guide you with that Yeah. Yeah.
0:09:46
So mostly it’s cash.
0:09:50
It would be good to start on the investment ladder.
0:09:52
So do you have any debts or anything?

CLIENT:
0:09:54
No. Other than.

ADVISOR:
0:09:56
Mortgage?
0:09:56
Yeah, it’s a mortgage, but that’s a good debt to have.
0:09:59
Do you have any plan for this money, this $130 K for now or. No.

CLIENT:
0:10:03
It’s just.
0:10:04
No, no, it’s just accumulating really.

ADVISOR:
0:10:06
So when you get a bonus, do you not put it into your 401(k)?

CLIENT:
0:10:10
No.
0:10:12
So, so obviously I’ve only just started.
0:10:14
Yeah, I think so.
0:10:15
Previously in my previous role, I was on about $117,000 a year.
0:10:18
So when I got the bonus, it kind of kept me with your 401(k) contributions and it kept me under the $150,000.
0:10:24
So I’ve kind of got in this place now where I.
0:10:27
Yeah, I’m going to have to squirrel a lot away in 401(k)s to try and avoid.
0:10:30
I would like to realistically I don’t need you know, I’ve got quite a lot of money left over a month.
0:10:35
I don’t need to have additional income, and I’d rather just keep my income below the $150,000 a year and keep the benefits that come with it.

ADVISOR:
0:10:43
It’s just I think because yours is going to turn three.
0:10:47
So you’ve got another really one year and a half of day‑care to pay then this one.
0:10:53
So really you are looking at two years and a half of putting a lot into your 401(k)s, less at the end of the month, but worst case you have a bit of cash.
0:11:01
We can just make a plan with that.
0:11:04
But I will definitely take the pain and put a lot more in my 401(k) for now because it’s worth the childcare.
0:11:11
How much you get is still worth it. Yeah, completely.
0:11:14
And losing it is actually you lose everything because you get taxed on. Yeah, completely.
0:11:18
All of that.
0:11:18
And you lose money at the end. Okay. Yeah.
0:11:20
Because I mean, I think you’re going to be looking at 25% of your 401(k).
0:11:24
But I’ll show you the numbers if you want. Yeah.
0:11:27
Yeah, that’d be great. Okay.
0:11:31
So would you mind if we do one exercise.
0:11:35
So first I would like to review your 401(k)s. So.
0:11:40
It’s called an authorization to release information. Yeah.
0:11:43
And I need you more or less to get.
0:11:45
I should have maybe told you about.
0:11:47
Maybe you have some advice to get your plan numbers.

CLIENT:
0:11:50
Yeah.
0:11:51
Let me grab my phone.
0:11:52
I’ve got it.
0:11:53
Sorry if that’s okay.

ADVISOR:
0:12:16
That’s not line up.
0:12:24
That’s your date of birth?

CLIENT:
0:12:25
January 8th, 1993.

ADVISOR:
0:12:29
1993. Okay.
0:12:31
You are like my brothers.
0:12:33
Yeah, but you are.
0:12:34
I’m a seventh year high.
0:12:37
Do you know your Social Security number?

CLIENT:
0:12:39
Yeah. One two three.

ADVISOR:
0:12:41
So one two?

CLIENT:
0:12:42
Yes 45. Yes 6789. Yes.

ADVISOR:
0:12:52
Put your address.
0:12:52
I’ve got your email.
0:12:53
Yeah I’ve got all that.
0:12:54
So you said BrightPath Workplace 401(k) and Vanguard Solo 401(k).

CLIENT:
0:12:59
Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:13:01
So just to explain to you what is this.
0:13:03
This is what we call an authorization to release information. Yeah.
0:13:06
By signing it, I’m going to be able to ask both of them all the information about your 401(k)s, how much you’re putting in what?
0:13:16
The performance of the funds.
0:13:17
What are the charges you are paying?
0:13:19
Having two retirement accounts, but most, most of the time doesn’t really make sense.
0:13:23
I agree that BrightPath might be not the best solutions.
0:13:26
So we can either have a look that if Vanguard Solo 401(k) is a good one or we just move to a different platform, usually with this type of amount, Fidelity Workplace Retirement is a good one and they have all the forms, but I go through that once I have all the information, so.
0:13:42
I’ll let you feel it.
0:13:43
So I have all this for you.
0:13:45
So don’t worry if you have the policy for now.
0:13:47
401(k) or which one did you get right now.

CLIENT:
0:13:50
So I’ve got, I’ve got Vanguard Solo 401(k) so.

ADVISOR:
0:13:52
If you can put it.

CLIENT:
0:13:52
Here. Yeah. One. Yeah.
0:14:06
So it’s $61,000 in there now actually 61.

ADVISOR:
0:14:09
I just put it down so I do up.

CLIENT:
0:14:12
Let me just find the account number for the other one.

ADVISOR:
0:14:17
And you need to sign it.
0:14:18
Name and date.

CLIENT:
0:14:29
Date today.

ADVISOR:
0:14:31
Yeah.

CLIENT:
0:14:31
Already December I’ve done anything for Christmas at all.

ADVISOR:
0:14:36
So what I can see that you haven’t put the Christmas stuff because I go to.
0:14:41
I went to a house earlier in just outside of Franklin.
0:14:44
Yeah, everything is out and I’m like, okay, you went all in.
0:14:46
It’s like I went away for four days and my partner got everything out, which for me, it needs to be December.
0:14:53
And I was like, it’s funny.

CLIENT:
0:14:56
I can’t until my.
0:14:58
So my daughter, her third birthday, she’s having a party on Sunday here. Nice.
0:15:03
But I was like, we wait until her party is done before we start thinking about Christmas to be honest.
0:15:08
But so okay, so no apologies. BrightPath Workplace 401(k). Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:15:14
Oh, why did I put.
0:15:16
No, it’s my fault.

CLIENT:
0:15:16
I don’t know.
Unrecognised
0:15:23
Okay. And then.

CLIENT:
0:15:27
Actually, BrightPath.

ADVISOR:
0:15:28
A 401(k) is better than no 401(k).
0:15:29
So I need to have a look at the font.

CLIENT:
0:15:34
Yeah I know because we used.
0:15:36
So where I was before J & R Apparel, we had basically Vanguard Solo 401(k) for the managers and then for the people who worked in the warehouse and things like that.
0:15:46
It was kind of BrightPath Workplace 401(k) is kind of the cheap and cheerful sort of platform like that.
0:15:50
And I guess that’s fine.
0:15:51
I just want to make sure.

ADVISOR:
0:15:53
They don’t want to change.
0:15:54
Have you mentioned it to them?

CLIENT:
0:15:55
No.

ADVISOR:
0:15:56
It’s not the best.
0:15:57
Not for an employee. No. For employers.

CLIENT:
0:15:59
So I think the way it’s been set up at the moment is it’s been set up at the moment is.
0:16:06
So what happens is if you’re an exec member, they have a pre‑tax 401(k) deferral arrangement. Yes.
0:16:13
Which basically means that you can pay into your own 401(k).
0:16:16
So rather than paying into a workplace 401(k), you like all the other employees you can pay into your workplace whatever 401(k) you want of your own choice.
0:16:22
So if you’ve got a Traditional IRA.
0:16:24
But at the moment I’m just a level below exec.
0:16:26
So at the moment they’re exploring the option to bring that down. Yeah.
0:16:30
But still I would like to keep all my funds Vanguard Solo 401(k), everything else combined into one 401(k), whether that be a Traditional IRA.
0:16:36
And then if, for example, these 401(k) contributions and we have pre‑tax 401(k) deferral arrangement, I can move the contributions to into that one fund.

ADVISOR:
0:16:45
So as a client I just saw is how between you I 37 sorry between you and I in terms of age and it’s got two 401(k)s.
0:16:54
One is what is important is the workplace, one is Schwab Workplace 401(k) and the other one is Vanguard Solo 401(k). Yeah.
0:16:59
Good performance of Vanguard Solo 401(k).
0:17:01
But Schwab Workplace 401(k) which is a workplace one whereas it gets pre‑tax 401(k) deferral arrangement and it’s going to do more additional contributions and we’re going to change.
0:17:07
So it’s not good.
0:17:09
So it’s got different options which is going to be kind of your different situation.
0:17:13
But either you leave it.
0:17:15
But you pay double fees and you don’t really help compounding or you decide, well, I move everything into my workplace 401(k) because I have to keep it.
0:17:24
But then I agree that the the performance is not great, but you know, this one is going to be in for 20 years, so that’s a shame.
0:17:31
Or which are we going to do is we keep Schwab Workplace 401(k) platform because we actually support it and like it.
0:17:36
And I changed the investment for you BrightPath Workplace 401(k) because it’s so limited.
0:17:41
We might need to do something different for a while, and maybe your company changed something and then or offer you to take another provider.
0:17:50
But for the time being you might have to have two 401(k) pots.
0:17:53
But as you said, every year, maybe you move on whenever there is a big or start to be a large decent amount like five K, you just move it to your 401(k).

CLIENT:
0:18:00
I mean, that’s fine.
0:18:01
I think the main thing for me in that light with that is just making sure that I get the matching employer contribution like that.
0:18:07
So hopefully I think what they will look to do in the next year is move to that pre‑tax 401(k) deferral model for senior leadership, and that will mean that they’ll pay employers contributions into a 401(k) of my choosing.
0:18:20
So that means I can just consolidate into one.
0:18:21
But yeah, I think we’ll just.

ADVISOR:
0:18:22
Set the maximum 2%.

CLIENT:
0:18:25
Yeah.
0:18:25
So they do 3%. Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:18:26
For you you can increase so it doesn’t matter.
0:18:28
But at least.
0:18:28
Yeah it’s yeah I agree. Okay.
0:18:31
well, at least for now, that’s what you’ve got.
0:18:33
So you can work with that.
0:18:34
And once pre‑tax 401(k) deferral companies have changed the whole game.
0:18:37
But you might have a really big contribution for a little while.
0:18:42
And when pre‑tax 401(k) deferral comes in it helps a little bit. Okay.

ADVISOR:
0:18:48
So that’s more or less how we kind of start.
0:18:52
So what I’m thinking is that so I’m going to send this to each 401(k) provider, get the information, come back to you and explain to you what you’ve got and what we could, what options you could have and why, and what’s the performance charges you’ve got linked to that.
0:19:04
Yeah, I definitely come back to you and brokerage account and maybe 529 College Savings Plan.
0:19:09
I don’t know how you feel about investment.
0:19:11
That’s what I want to do to make you do.
0:19:12
I want to make you do a questionnaire. Sorry. Yeah.
0:19:16
Would it be possible to quickly log in to your Wi‑Fi?

CLIENT:
0:19:19
Yeah. Of course.
0:19:24
Thank you very much. Wi‑Fi. Okay.
0:19:29
As the password if you want it.

ADVISOR:
0:19:33
So it’s called is it Wi‑Fi or.

CLIENT:
0:19:36
I’m sorry.
0:19:37
So it’s called home Wi‑Fi or Wi‑Fi.
0:19:52
So you have two kids? Yeah.
0:19:55
One I can remember.
0:20:02
Well, what made you stop investment banking?

ADVISOR:
0:20:05
As a non flexibility of it.
0:20:08
I was working 6:45 a.m. in the morning to mostly 6 p.m. in the evenings and lunch on my desk and all of that.
0:20:16
And it was great.
0:20:17
I loved it.
0:20:19
I loved the job.
0:20:20
I’m not going to lie.
0:20:20
But it’s just I.
0:20:23
I used to run the desk in a fixed income sales in the Dutch bank, Charlotte. Yeah.
0:20:28
And then something happened in Asia and we were quite a satellite desk compared to New York City.
0:20:32
So it’s still connected.
0:20:34
And, and they decided to shut down the whole thing.
0:20:38
So I got laid off with all my old team.
0:20:40
But what happened is I was pregnant three months, but I hadn’t told them yet.
0:20:45
But every year they keep asking me, oh, but why don’t you come to New York City, cover bigger clients and all of that?
0:20:51
And when this happened, I was like, well, why don’t you offer me a job in New York City?
0:20:55
Because I used to.
0:20:57
I mean, why why not?
0:20:59
Why are you laying me off? You.
0:21:01
I always thought I was good and I still connected, and I didn’t tell them I was pregnant.
0:21:09
They offered me a job the week after.
0:21:11
So I took the job and I waited.
0:21:13
It’s legally you have to tell them until you are five months pregnant.
0:21:16
Yeah, so I told them.
0:21:18
Oh, I didn’t like it.
0:21:19
Oh, can I try again?

CLIENT:
0:21:20
Yeah, yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:21:20
Should I next network security. Yeah, yeah.
0:21:26
And more or less.
0:21:29
I went there, toured them, worked until my due date and hadn’t come, didn’t come back.
0:21:34
I think I worked there for ten years, so I wanted my maternity leave.
0:21:37
Yeah, it’s a good maternity leave.

CLIENT:
0:21:39
Completely.

ADVISOR:
0:21:40
So hence we also have kids really close by because it was it really made sense for my career. Yeah. Yeah.
0:21:46
So I only took two months leave with Deutsche Bank and pass all my exams and just became financial advisor there.

CLIENT:
0:21:53
Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:21:53
And great. Thanks.
0:21:57
Well, that’s what he was doing with me as well. Let’s see.
0:21:59
It’s connecting or connected?
0:22:01
No it is.
0:22:03
We know how to do it.
0:22:04
Thank you for that. Sorry. And honestly. Great.
0:22:07
So I don’t work Wednesdays anymore.
0:22:08
I mean, that job was amazing.
0:22:10
It was really good.
0:22:11
And I’m not going to lie, it was really well paid. Yeah.
0:22:14
So it has helped me to be in a situation where I do what I want. Really.
0:22:19
But that’s why I would say to you, you really should start to invest in either.

CLIENT:
0:22:24
Yeah, I think I come from, like, quite a conservative family.
0:22:30
Cash in the bank, you know.
0:22:31
So I think, don’t get me wrong, I’ve always done investing, but I would say, you know, about $6,500 at best.
0:22:38
Everything else has been sat in cash.
0:22:40
But really getting to the levels now where actually it’s just.

ADVISOR:
0:22:43
A large amount. Yeah.
0:22:44
Even if you keep like three months of that savings into a bank account and you have so much at the end of the month.

CLIENT:
0:22:51
Yes.
0:22:51
And I think between us, you know, obviously pension obviously I will put some more into pension.
0:22:56
But it is well for you you.

ADVISOR:
0:22:58
Need a few.

CLIENT:
0:22:59
Years. Yeah.
0:22:59
We’ve probably got excess income, uh, excess income of $4,000 to $6,500 once we obviously start paying for the childcare and that.
0:23:06
So it’s just.

ADVISOR:
0:23:07
Going to look different once they are in school. Yeah.
0:23:09
That’s what I tell my husband.
0:23:10
Because to me I completely understand where you are at because what happened is I got I know my game.
0:23:18
So I got laid off after New York City.
0:23:20
I asked for it and I knew when to ask for it.
0:23:22
So in December.
0:23:24
Whenever I happened, I asked, well, I’m thinking to re I’m thinking to not come back.
0:23:30
So if there’s any lay‑off package, I think of me have in mind.
0:23:34
I hadn’t been there for a year and a half. Yeah.
0:23:36
So obviously they took it especially I took them three months before his bonus time, five months before coming back.
0:23:43
So I gave them plenty of time.
0:23:44
So I got a massive check for that.
0:23:47
So I didn’t get any subsidized hours at the beginning.
0:23:50
So with my husband, we paid.
0:23:53
We were paying about $2,500 of day‑care fees for like from April to September.
0:24:00
And I told my husband, look, it’s going to be I’m sorry, but we can’t just there’s no way I can just dissipate it.
0:24:06
We just can’t.
0:24:06
We have to take the hit. Yeah.
0:24:08
Then September started.
0:24:09
We started to have the reduced hours again, and then March.
0:24:12
We’re going to have more.
0:24:13
And now I can see like I can see the invoice just going down. Going down.
0:24:16
And it’s like, yes.

CLIENT:
0:24:17
Finally getting there. Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:24:19
So this is a questionnaire where I could read you the question, by whether you read them yourself and you take your time.
0:24:24
So this is called attitude to risk. Yeah.
0:24:26
It’s just to see how you feel about money.
0:24:29
Have in mind that you have money that is locked for 20 years, but also money that is available. Available now.
0:24:35
So it’s more like a general approach with money. Makes sense.

CLIENT:
0:24:37
Okay.

ADVISOR:
0:24:38
Take your time.
0:26:51
What does your wife do?

CLIENT:
0:26:53
She works insurance broker in Waynesboro. Okay.

ADVISOR:
0:27:04
What’s your name?

CLIENT:
0:27:05
Megan.
0:27:06
Megan was okay. Yeah, yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:27:08
T h.

CLIENT:
0:27:09
Yeah. Megan. Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:27:12
I just I don’t like to say wife.

CLIENT:
0:27:14
No, no. Thank you.

ADVISOR:
0:27:17
Cool.
0:27:17
So you are moderately adventurous.
0:27:18
For someone who says, I’m quite cautious with money.
0:27:20
Yeah, you are, but actually, have you read this or can I read it?

CLIENT:
0:27:23
Yeah, yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:27:24
Of course.
0:27:24
So, Samuel, you are prepared to take a medium degree of risk with your investment in return for the prospect of improving longer term investment performance.
0:27:32
Short term capital protection is not important to you, and you are willing to sacrifice some long term protection for the likelihood of greater returns.
0:27:39
To be fair, that’s definitely true because you are.
0:27:41
You are thinking to put a lot of money into your pension that you won’t touch for 20 years plus. Yeah.
0:27:46
But you also have a large part where you can have a saving pot and investment on the side.
0:27:51
A typical moderate to adventurous investor would be invested mainly in equities, but with other assets included, to provide some diversification.
0:27:58
There may be a small amount of specialised equity within the portfolio. Yeah.
0:28:03
What would be interesting is at some point when Megan or I can send you a link and you give it to her, is to do the same risk, same test, if you don’t mind.
0:28:13
So at least because it’s the beauty of being two.
0:28:16
You’ve got two allowances.
0:28:17
So if we were doing investment for each, you might she might have a different profile. Yeah.
0:28:21
Which would be fine.
0:28:22
But we need to take this into consideration. Yeah.

CLIENT:
0:28:25
No, no.
0:28:25
If you’re happy to share you’re happy to share the link.

ADVISOR:
0:28:27
Yes. Okay.
0:28:30
Do you have any questions for now?

CLIENT:
0:28:32
No, no. It’s fine.
0:28:33
I think from my point of view, I guess I think you mentioned first and second meetings free, isn’t it? Yeah, yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:28:39
That’s. Yeah.
0:28:40
So it’s just right now you gave me a lot of information.
0:28:45
And thank you for this.
0:28:46
I’m just going to put it that I’m going to send you a card for, for, for to do the attitude to risk questionnaire. Second meeting.
0:28:57
When I come back more or less I have a plan for everything.
0:28:59
I have either information I plan maybe an idea of how you could look at spreading your money differently or and also invest either either all of that.
0:29:10
And it’s only you are like also I know you have a pension.
0:29:14
What I do with people like you is I start with, like, the minimum fees.
0:29:18
So you would be a $1,000 client?
0:29:20
I won’t touch.
0:29:21
I know you have more into your pension, but that’s okay. I.
0:29:24
So 1,000, for example. It would.
0:29:26
It would be for everything if we were doing so.
0:29:29
But for now to get the information from the companies, the pension providers can take up to 2 or 3 weeks. Yeah.
0:29:37
So before maybe I have it before Christmas, maybe not.
0:29:40
But then I just message you when?
0:29:42
When it’s possible.
0:29:43
I don’t think it’s worth to lock you for a date when I don’t know if we’re going to have it before Christmas.

CLIENT:
0:29:47
No. That’s fine.
0:29:48
You’ve got my number, haven’t you? Yes.

ADVISOR:
0:29:50
And you don’t mind me? What’s that?
0:29:51
No no no.

CLIENT:
0:29:51
No.
0:29:52
That works perfect for me.

ADVISOR:
0:29:53
And that’s it. Really?
0:29:56
I could leave you this. It’s.
0:29:59
It’s how we call a centralised investment proposition.
0:30:03
What I want to say is, I could give you next time, but it’s just for you.
0:30:06
It’s how we work.
0:30:07
So all the investment and funds we work with, we review them on a monthly basis.
0:30:12
We meet the fund managers every year minimum or these funds we like.
0:30:18
Like always, we meet them every quarter.
0:30:20
We have platforms that we support more than others that we prefer like Schwab Workplace 401(k), Fidelity Workplace Retirement, TD Ameritrade Institutional.
0:30:26
But it’s all about how much money Fidelity is good for smaller portfolios and TD Ameritrade is good for us.
0:30:31
With $500 K, $100 K $1 million clients.
0:30:33
So you will see more Fidelity and you can have all your family in it.
0:30:37
Do you know that there is no platform fees with them which I think is great. Yeah, yeah.
0:30:42
So it just gives you a bit of color of who we are, how we work and that’s great.
0:30:46
All of that.

CLIENT:
0:30:47
That’s okay. Yeah. That’s perfect. Thank you.

ADVISOR:
0:30:49
For Megan.
0:30:50
Do you I’ll let you talk to her.

CLIENT:
0:30:52
Yeah.
0:30:53
Well, I think if you share that link.
0:30:54
Let me, let me. Sorry.
0:30:56
You shared so.

ADVISOR:
0:30:57
So you know, I know what I can do.
0:30:58
I can add her.
0:30:59
And that means let me just do it properly now because that’s done up. She.
0:31:08
There’s no rush.
0:31:09
She does it when she can. Yeah.
0:31:12
For that second meeting. That’s it.
0:31:14
But you will receive it on your email yourself.
0:31:16
So you just forward it to her.
0:31:21
Include a spouse or partner.
0:31:24
Are you married?

CLIENT:
0:31:25
No.
0:31:25
No, we’re not married. Okay.

ADVISOR:
0:31:27
So what’s your last name?

CLIENT:
0:31:29
Thompson.

ADVISOR:
0:31:29
Thompson. Like Thompson.

CLIENT:
0:31:31
T h o m p - son. Yes, yes.

ADVISOR:
0:31:33
And what’s your date of birth, please?

CLIENT:
0:31:36
July 2nd, 1987.

ADVISOR:
0:31:41
1987?

CLIENT:
0:31:42
Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:31:42
Oh, she’s my age.

CLIENT:
0:31:48
Cool.

ADVISOR:
0:31:51
OOP. Sorry.
0:31:52
I just put your number because you’re going to get a pin, so. Yeah. Megan up. Female.
0:31:58
I’ll put your birth date to a date.
0:32:00
So you’re not married?
0:32:02
Have you done a will?

CLIENT:
0:32:04
No I haven’t. No.

ADVISOR:
0:32:05
You should.

CLIENT:
0:32:06
Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:32:08
Really?
0:32:09
Very much for protection of your kids and your assets.
0:32:11
Now, if something happened because you’re not married, it’s a it’s a different game. Yeah.
0:32:16
Are you thinking to get married? I’m sorry.
0:32:20
No, no, no.

CLIENT:
0:32:20
Fair question.

ADVISOR:
0:32:21
She’s not here.

CLIENT:
0:32:21
No no, no.
0:32:22
We’ve we’ve been engaged for.

ADVISOR:
0:32:24
Oh. You’re engaged?

CLIENT:
0:32:24
Yeah, we are engaged.
0:32:25
But I’m not married, so. Sorry.

ADVISOR:
0:32:27
You are engaged?

CLIENT:
0:32:28
Yeah, we are engaged, but.
0:32:31
It’s been about five years.
0:32:32
We’ve been engaged.
0:32:33
So it’s not. Yeah. It’s not.

ADVISOR:
0:32:36
Okay. Fair enough.
0:32:41
I like that you will see the documents online as well. Like this.
0:32:44
You have everything.
0:32:47
So is the idea just to book the wedding that is more or less holding there?

CLIENT:
0:32:51
I think so.
0:32:52
I think just neither of us have, you know, we got engaged before, and then neither of us have really spoke about it that much anymore.
0:32:58
And I think neither of us are really flashy or want a big day or anything like that, and I think. Yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:33:04
So, so for the for the security of your kids, Would you just not go to the county clerk’s office?
0:33:10
Yeah, I think you should go. Yeah, it’s.
0:33:13
You know, it’s sad.
0:33:14
I work with a lot of attorneys.
0:33:15
If you ever need a contact, they see some really sad stories of people who have kids and just being married, just putting the signature together.
0:33:25
Even if you don’t want a party.
0:33:26
But at least you’re not just engaged now.
0:33:28
You are in this country.
0:33:31
You are recognized as a married couple.
0:33:33
It makes things a lot more easier.
0:33:35
A will is obviously the next step because then it’s a lot easier if something happens.
0:33:39
I know we are young, but me personally, Covid did show me that it can happen all the time.
0:33:44
So I have a will now with a trust and all of that.

CLIENT:
0:33:46
Yeah, I think it’s it’s definitely something I really need to consider and yeah, and everything else I think it’s just yeah.

ADVISOR:
0:33:54
What’s a good time.
0:33:55
Let’s do this.
0:33:56
And then after you can have a think about the rest.
0:33:57
But I think it might be worth it. Yeah. Completely. Any questions?

CLIENT:
0:34:00
No I think that’s everything. Yeah. You’re good. Yeah.
0:34:02
Thank you for your time.

ADVISOR:
0:34:04
Thank you for having me.
0:34:05
Let me log this.
