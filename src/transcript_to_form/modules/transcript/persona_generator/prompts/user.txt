Create two distinct, non-eccentric personas: one financial advisor and one of their client.

For each persona, provide:

- Name: A suitable first and last name.
- Personality Description: A concise, vivid summary of their personality, focusing on their general demeanor, communication style, and approach to financial matters. This should not include factual background, only character traits.

The personas should be suitable for generating realistic financial planning conversation transcripts.
