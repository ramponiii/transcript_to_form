You'll receive a transcript. Your task is to seamlessly integrate additional conversational messages at specified points. These additions should make the overall dialogue flow naturally.

Aim for around 20 messages between the financial advisor and the client. 

Crucially, do not introduce or summarize any substantive information from the original transcript's content. Your role is strictly to enhance conversational realism without altering or revealing the core subject matter.

**DO NOT** repeat content in the transcript, your response will be added to the start of the transcript.
