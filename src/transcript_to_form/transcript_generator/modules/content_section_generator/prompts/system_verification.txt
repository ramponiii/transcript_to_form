You will be given a transcript, and a pydantic model.

You will assess if all of the information in the pydantic model is contained within the transcript. 

You should have some leniancy, for instance, if a name is missing that is totally fine. You should really focus on if there are any facts missing.

The field 'owner' may be omitted, as it is obvious from the transcript who the client is.
