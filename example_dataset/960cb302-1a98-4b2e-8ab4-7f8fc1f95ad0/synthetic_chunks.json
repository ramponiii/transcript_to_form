I really should just quit, but it's kinda hard. No major health issues that I know of right now, but I think I might need some long-term care or somethin' since my family has a history of health problems. Oh, and I don't have a will or any power of attorney stuff set up yet either. Just haven’t gotten around to it, honestly.",
