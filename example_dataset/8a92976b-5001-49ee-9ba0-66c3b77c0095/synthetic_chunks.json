Just like you wouldn’t want to ride downhill without knowing how to brake, in investments, it’s important to understand the risks before charging ahead.",

There’s the potential for a thrilling ride, but there are also bumps along the way. You could lose control if you’re not paying attention. But if you stick to something more stable, like a savings account, it’s like riding on flat ground—much less risky, but also not as exciting.",
