And, like, the monthly payment is like, hmmm, $1200, I guess? And I don't I think there's, um, like, a special rate involved, or somethin’, it’s fixed or whatever. I dunno, something about, eh, until '25 I think. Oh, and the balance is, uh, uhh, maybe around, let's see, that’s, um, like $300,000? The interest, I’m not sure, but it's around, uhh, 3%? Yeah, that's it, I think... Oh, and the final payment or whatever, that’s, um, toward the end of, uhh, '30? Not sure if there's more info you need, I don’t have notes or anything.",
