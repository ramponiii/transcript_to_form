I dunno, but, um, it depends on, like, how my work goes and if, like, I’m still up for it, you know? Sometimes I feel, I dunno, really tired with my job and, um, just wanna, like, relax and travel a bit, but then again, there’s the money and, you know, what if I can’t afford it? So, yeah, 65 sounds okay but I'd like to, um, keep working part-time maybe?",
