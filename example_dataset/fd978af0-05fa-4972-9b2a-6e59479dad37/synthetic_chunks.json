And then, like, groceries, like, I spend like, I dunno, maybe 300, but, uh, that's sometimes more? Also, uh, yeah the insurance—I think that’s like, what, 100? I pay it like, every month too. Oh! And don’t forget the Netflix thingy, which is, uh, fifteen bucks a month. It's kinda important, but I guess I could do without it?",
