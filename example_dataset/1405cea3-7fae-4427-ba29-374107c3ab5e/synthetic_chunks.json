Uh, my monthly costs are screwy, it's like around 1200 a month, and uh, the balance? Uh, I think it's around 200,000? But, um, the interest rate is kinda high, like 5.5% or something. I got a special rate for a couple of years, like 3% fixed until 2025, um and I gotta pay it off by, uh, I think it’s 2030.",
