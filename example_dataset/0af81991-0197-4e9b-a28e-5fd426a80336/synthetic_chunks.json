            "client_message": "Hmm, I guess that’s a tough one. I mean, if it drops, part of me says to maybe hold on and see, but then another part thinks, uh, should I just sell and cut my losses? I kinda feel uncertain about it.",

            "client_message": "Yeah, uh, that sounds more comfortable, I guess? Just knowing it’s more stable gives me some peace of mind, but then I'd wonder if I'm missing out on bigger gains with stocks, y’know?",
