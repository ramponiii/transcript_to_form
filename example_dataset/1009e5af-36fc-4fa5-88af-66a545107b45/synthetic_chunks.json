Imagine your family, if something happens to you, they would get a payout, like, say fifty thousand dollars probably? And it costs, like, you know, maybe just fifty bucks a month or so. If it's written in trust, it means the money goes directly to them without issues.",

Oh, and I think it’s not in trust though, uh, not sure. But I want it to, like, help with any expenses for my family if, you know, anything happens. And, um, I guess it covers until I retire?",
