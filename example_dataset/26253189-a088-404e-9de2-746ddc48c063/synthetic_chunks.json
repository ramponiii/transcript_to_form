If they're, uh, smoking a pack a day, that could, uh, impact their health a lot. So, uh, it's really important to, uh, know your current health state, right? And, um, have you, you know, mentioned if you smoke or, uh, have any other health concerns?",

My health's, like, not great but, uh, I haven't really thought about long-term care or anything, you know? I'm just kinda getting by. But, um, I don’t got a will or power of attorney or any of that stuff either. Maybe I should, huh?",
