If you, you know, contribute 100 bucks a month, it could grow over time. I mean, it it's important to know, like, the, uh, the current value of your fund, like whatever that may be, ya know? Something like 15,000?",

I think I remember it being around 15 grand, but gotta check. And, um, the policy number’s in my email somewhere, just gotta dig it up. I might have some notes on it, too.",
