When we talk about a policy being 'written in trust,' it means that the policy benefits will be paid to a specific trustee rather than the estate of the insured. This can help in avoiding probate and ensuring that your beneficiaries receive the funds directly. It’s a way to manage the payout in a more efficient manner for your loved ones.",
            "client_message": "Oh, I see. That makes sense! So, if I want my family to get the money directly, writing it in trust is a good idea? What about the amount I would get if something happens? How does that work?",

            "advisor_message": "Exactly! If the policy is written in trust, your family will receive the payout directly and typically faster. As for the amount assured, this is the value that your policy will pay out. For example, if you have a life assurance policy for £100,000, your beneficiaries would receive that amount in the event of your passing.",
            "client_message": "Got it! So, if I have a life assurance policy for say, £100,000, my family would get that amount, and I can decide how they receive it by having it written in trust? That’s really helpful to know!",
