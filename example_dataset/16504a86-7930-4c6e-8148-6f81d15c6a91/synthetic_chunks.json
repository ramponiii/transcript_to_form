            "advisor_message": "So, think of investing like sailing a boat. There are times when the waters are smooth, and your journey is easy. That's low risk; you can predict where you'll go. But there are also times when the seas get rough, which represents high risk. In those moments, you can get tossed around. It's important to choose how much risk you're comfortable with, just like picking the right weather to set sail.",
            "client_message": "I see, but it feels like every time I think I understand, there’s like, a new term or, you know, concept that throws me off. What if the boat capsizes? What does that mean for my money?",

            "advisor_message": "Great question! Capping a boat in this analogy means losing your investment. But just as sailors learn to adjust their sails in rough weather, as an investor, you can diversify your assets to manage that risk. You wouldn’t just sail with one boat, right? You might have a smaller dinghy for calm days and a sturdier vessel for stormy ones.",
            "client_message": "Right, that makes sense. But I’m still a bit lost about how to decide what kind of assets are like each boat. I mean, how do I know which ones are sturdy?",

            "advisor_message": "Exactly! It's about understanding the value and risk profile of each asset. Just like you’d inspect a boat for its build quality before taking it out—look at its current value versus its original investment. That helps in forecasting potential risks. Moreover, having a mix of both sturdy and lighter assets can protect you when the market gets choppy.",
            "client_message": "Okay, so I should be looking at both what I paid for, and what it's worth now? I guess that makes it a little clearer. It just feels overwhelming sometimes, you know?",
