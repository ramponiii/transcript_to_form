            "client_message": "Okay, so like... if I go faster with my investments, there's a bigger chance I could lose money? But I get there faster?",

            "advisor_message": "Exactly! So, if you choose something riskier, like stocks, it's like speeding. You have the potential for great returns, but also the risk of a crash. On the other hand, if you invest in something stable like bonds, that's like driving within the speed limit – safer but slower growth.",

            "client_message": "Mhm, okay. That makes sense. So... I shouldn’t put all my savings in, like, high-risk stuff? Got it!",
