I mean, I’ve been smoking since, like, I was 18, and probably around a pack a day, or maybe a bit less. So, um, I don't really have any long-term care needs now but, uh, I know I might need help down the road if things don’t go so well. And I do have a will, but it’s kinda old. I should probably update it, right?",
