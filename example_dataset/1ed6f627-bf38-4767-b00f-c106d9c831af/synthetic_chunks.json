            "client_message": "Yeah, that's me. I'm the owner of the mortgage. It's actually for my house. But the loan type is a bit more complicated, I guess it's just a standard mortgage. Um, my provider is ABC Bank, and I think the monthly cost is around 1,200 dollars or so. Oh, and the outstanding value? It's about 150,000 right now. I also have a special rate at 3.5% that's fixed until 2025. I'm not sure exactly when the last payment is due, but I think it's sometime in 2031.",
