Just like a performer, you have to know how far you can lean without losing your balance. How do you feel about that analogy?",
            "client_message": "Um, I get what you mean, but it kinda makes me anxious imagining falling. So, like, does that mean if I fall in the investment world, I end up losing a lot?",
