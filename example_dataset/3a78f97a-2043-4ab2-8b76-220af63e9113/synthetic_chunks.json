If it’s a quiet residential road, you might cross it without much thought. But if it’s a busy highway, you’re going to be more careful and look both ways.",

In investing, high-risk investments can lead to big gains but also big losses. You want to be cautious, just like you wouldn’t sprint across without looking.",
