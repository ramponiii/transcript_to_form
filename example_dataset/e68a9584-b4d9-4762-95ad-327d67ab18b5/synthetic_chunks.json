Oh, and I have this National Insurance number too, um, I think it’s ABC123456D. Oh, and, like, I work at a supermarket? Just part-time, but yeah, that's, um, my employment status. Anyway, I'm hoping to retire when I'm like, 65 or so, I guess. Might be earlier or later, not sure. I started working, hmm, maybe last year but I don’t remember the exact date. Sorry! Oh, and I think I’m in the 20 percent tax bracket, like the highest I pay, if that matters.",
