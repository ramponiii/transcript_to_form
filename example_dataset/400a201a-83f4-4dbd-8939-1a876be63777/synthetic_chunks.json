A Defined Contribution plan means that both you and your employer contribute a fixed amount to your retirement fund, and the final benefit you receive depends on the performance of those investments. In contrast, a Defined Benefit plan guarantees a specific payout at retirement, regardless of investment performance. Does that help clarify it?",
            "client_message": "Yes, that makes sense. So with my plan, it’s all about how well the investments do over time?",
