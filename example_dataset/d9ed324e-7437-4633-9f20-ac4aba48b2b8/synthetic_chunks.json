And, oh! I’ve got this, uh, savings account, but it’s not like huge or anything—just a couple of thousand, uh, saved up? It’s with that bank, you know, the one on Main Street? Anyway, I wanna make sure I have enough, but I’m also thinking about, like, getting some investments, like maybe a property or something to, um, rent out later? But I'm not really sure, so I guess I need to think about it, right? Also, I have no clue how to, like, plan for all of this! So, yeah, that’s kinda my ramble on the retirement thing.",
