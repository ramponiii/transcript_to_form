But if you pick the right waves, you can really ride them well and have a great time. It’s all about choosing the right wave to catch.",
            "client_message": "I kinda get that, but like, what if I choose the wrong wave? Does that mean I’ll just lose all my money or something?",

            "advisor_message": "Exactly! It’s about balancing the small waves with the bigger, riskier ones. Some waves are more predictable, which is like investing in safer stocks. Others are big and thrilling, but there's a chance of falling off, much like high-risk investments. You want to manage your choices carefully.",
            "client_message": "Oh, okay, but it still feels a bit overwhelming, like, are there really safe waves out there? Do all waves have risks?",

            "advisor_message": "Great question! Think of it like this: even calm waves can surprise you. But yes, some waves—like blue-chip stocks—have a history of being more stable. It's about finding your comfort level and which risks you’re okay with taking.",
            "client_message": "That makes sense, I guess... so, like I don’t wanna get completely wiped out, but I do want to catch some good rides too. So maybe a mix would help?",
