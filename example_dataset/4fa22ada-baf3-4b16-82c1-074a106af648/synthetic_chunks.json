Now, if we look at the total outstanding balance, it might be around, you know, $200,000 or so. The interest rate could be, say, 3.5%, but if you have a special rate, like 2.5% fixed until, uh, like 2030, that's a big deal. Your final payment, let's say it's due on 2035-12-01. Just thinkin' 'bout that can really help you see the bigger picture here. What do you think?",
