Risk is like the wind – it can be unpredictable. Sometimes it’s strong, sometimes it’s light. You can either embrace it and learn to navigate, or just stay on the shore.",
            "client_message": "Uh, I get the boat thing but, like, how do I actually know when the wind is gonna change? Like, what if I just, um, stay on the shore forever? I don't want to miss out, but I don't really understand the whole risk part.",

            "advisor_message": "Exactly! Staying on the shore means missing exciting voyages, but feeling safe. So, we put together a plan that helps you weigh the risks, just like checking weather reports before a sailing trip. If we know a storm's coming, we can choose to sail on a calmer day instead.",
            "client_message": "Okay, that makes sense, but how do I choose a calm day? I mean, isn’t there like a way to make sure I don’t just end up in a storm then?",
