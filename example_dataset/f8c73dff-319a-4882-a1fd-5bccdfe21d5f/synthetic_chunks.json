So, um, it's a Life Assurance policy, I think, uh, through, uh, Generali, which is like an insurance company. And I pay, uh, I think it’s about 50 pounds a month, you know? The amount it pays out is, like, 100,000 pounds. Um, yeah, we're not, like, putting it in trust or anything. I think it covers, like, until 2060 or something like that. The aim of it, uh, well, I guess it's just to protect our family, you know? Just in case something happens.",
