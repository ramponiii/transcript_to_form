If you estimate that your monthly expenses will be around five thousand dollars, then we can start calculating how much you'll need to save. This is a great base to use for our discussion about your retirement objectives.",

For instance, if you have a diversified portfolio that grows at an average of 6% per year, we can use that assumption to project your savings.",
