I mean, that's, that’s before taxes, I think? And then, you know, I also do some rental stuff, but it’s kinda not that consistent, y’know? Like, sometimes I get it weekly, sometimes it can be, uh, like, months in between. So, this one place, it pays around, uh, what, seven hundred, I think, when I get it? Not sure if that’ll last forever though, because, y’know, things change? And I'm planning on, uh, retiring by twenty thirty? Maybe? I dunno, but I hope to have enough to, like, travel and stuff, just enjoy life, you know?",
