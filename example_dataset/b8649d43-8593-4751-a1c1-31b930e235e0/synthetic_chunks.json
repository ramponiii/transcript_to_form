For example, if the wind gets really strong, you might want to lower your exposure to riskier investments, like stocks, similar to how a sailor would reduce the sail size to keep control of the ship.",

            "client_message": "Right, right, I see. So my other pension, like with the Defined Contribution, I should look into adjusting those more often? Also, what's the current value of that again? I think it w-was mentioned somewhere.",
