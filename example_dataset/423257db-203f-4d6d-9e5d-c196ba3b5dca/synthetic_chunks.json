And maybe, like, get a little place by the beach or something, that would be amazing. But I also want to, uh, give back, like, volunteer and help out in the community, so there's that too.",

Plus, I'd probably need, like, insurance and stuff. So, uh, maybe around, I dunno, two thousand a month, just for the place? And, oh! I almost forgot about groceries and utilities! They add up, you know? But I think it's all super important for my happiness in retirement.",
