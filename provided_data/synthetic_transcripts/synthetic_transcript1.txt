ADVISOR: [00:00:01] We are with Jennifer and Jerome. Want some? Okay, so Prudential annuity. This annuity. Okay, one. And then there’s a workplace Vanguard four oh one kay.

CLIENT1: [00:00:09] Workplace one, which is only ten years old.

ADVISOR: [00:00:13] Good, Ten year. You said ten years. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:00:17] And that the valuation on that today is 33 thousand.

ADVISOR: [00:00:24] Okay. That’s fine. I, I need I will do. Are we going to talk about one more details on stuff. That’s fine.

CLIENT1: [00:00:31] If you want to know about payments in this one I pay $28.50.

ADVISOR: [00:00:36] I don’t want to know this. I want to know other things. This is good. It’s just for me. It’s like details. What I want to know is after. Okay, but don’t tell me.

CLIENT1: [00:00:46] And then the final one is this one.

ADVISOR: [00:00:47] Which is Fidelity IRA.

CLIENT1: [00:00:49] The main one.

ADVISOR: [00:00:49] Okay, cool.

CLIENT1: [00:00:50] That’s that’s current today.

ADVISOR: [00:00:52] So is that an old four oh one kay plan? Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay. Super.

CLIENT1: [00:00:57] That was with summit and oak financial got me to change it to Fidelity IRA. About a year ago.

ADVISOR: [00:01:03] Well, okay. And how did they invest you? Did they invest? Can I ask a couple of questions when they invest? Fidelity is great, by the way. It’s really good. It’s a cheap platform. There’s no problem with that. And I’m the fact that they moved you probably means that it’s a modern policy allowing you or could allow you to draw from the IRA if you wanted to. When you did all that, did you mention to them you wanted to retire in 2025?

CLIENT1: [00:01:26] Yeah, I think so.

ADVISOR: [00:01:28] Can I see how you are invested really quickly? Like so did you do a risk profile and did they go through the volatility of the market and all of that.

CLIENT1: [00:01:36] Yeah this is it.

ADVISOR: [00:01:39] I mean I’m going to make you do another one I’m afraid. But. Oh you are. You are five. But they didn’t invest you as a five did you. Did they.

CLIENT1: [00:01:46] No. I think we decided that and then they for some reason, they made it more cautious, I think, because of the time. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:01:55] No. It’s good, it’s good It’s good because, you know, December 2025 is tomorrow. If today are any of these retirement accounts, if today a new Covid happened or anything a war happen, your portfolio is going to go down by 20%. When we are even some with some clients two years before retirement, we try to invest them in a more in a different way. We invest them. It depends what they want to do. We’re going to talk about drawing from the IRA or annuities and all of that. But if they want to draw from the IRA we we have a way to invest, which is 15% cash, I would say 35% into like a cautious risk and then medium risk after because like this, the money keep working for you for all the years that’s going to still go come behind. But the idea is you have money that is almost not invested. So if the market does 20% drop, it doesn’t matter because you have this money available right now and then hopefully with the time because it’s cautious in the middle some of the funds, they are not too volatile because it’s not about performance. When you get to retirement, it’s more about being conservative, about the money is for your future. Now you worked all your life. It’s not about taking the risk with making money. It’s about making sure the money is still working because you still haven’t asked your age. How old are.

CLIENT1: [00:03:09] We’re both 64. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:03:11] You are still young. You’ve got like, 30 years in front of you. You’re going to do a lot in the next 15 years is where you’re going to spend most of your money. If I’m honest, after you, you will slow down because it looks like it’s how it is. But what we tend to do, or it’s my view at least, is we we reduce a lot the volatility for a part of the portfolio, but with another part that is still working hard for you to have enough money for the 30 years. Now let’s talk about it. You mentioned annuity, drawing from the IRA, all of that. Are you quite knowledgeable about those parts? Yeah. Do you think you want an annuity?

CLIENT1: [00:03:50] That’s I’m not decided 100% at the moment. Yeah. That’s okay. When I was saying to you about what my ideas are and what my ideas are if out of these three things I could achieve, say, 10 to 12 thousands a year income. Yeah with a 50% payment to Jennifer if I died.

ADVISOR: [00:04:23] Oh, yes. Yeah. Well if it’s an annuity, we most of the time. Well, you can choose 100% or two third or one third. I’m just doing one for a client. You can choose the type of policy. If it’s drawing from the IRA, usually it’s a total pot that goes to Jennifer.

CLIENT1: [00:04:38] Yeah. So if I could do that and take take the tax‑free withdrawal. Of course I’d be. I’d be happy. So if that’s achievable.

ADVISOR: [00:04:51] Yeah. So can I ask more questions now? What what do you do currently?

CLIENT1: [00:05:02] I’m a logistics manager.

ADVISOR: [00:05:03] Logistics manager. How much do you earn?

CLIENT1: [00:05:07] 43. Okay.

ADVISOR: [00:05:09] And you, Jennifer? If are you working?

CLIENT2: [00:05:11] Customer Service Associate for Kroger.

ADVISOR: [00:05:14] Customer service, Kroger. Full time?

CLIENT2: [00:05:18] Part time.

ADVISOR: [00:05:18] Part time.

ADVISOR: [00:05:20] May I ask your income?

CLIENT2: [00:05:22] Roughly between six. What are we working at? That? Sorry. 11 thousand.

CLIENT1: [00:05:28] 11.

CLIENT2: [00:05:29] Between 10 and 11 thousand a year.

ADVISOR: [00:05:32] Okay. So you’re under the tax bracket, which is cool. How much do you need per month currently?

CLIENT1: [00:05:40] How much?

ADVISOR: [00:05:41] Well, how much do you how much do you need per month to live and be happy?

ADVISOR: [00:05:46] That’s.

ADVISOR: [00:05:47] Why I’m going here. But I want to ask questions first.

CLIENT1: [00:05:51] Well.

ADVISOR: [00:05:54] Do you have a mortgage?

CLIENT1: [00:05:55] No.

ADVISOR: [00:05:56] Okay.

CLIENT1: [00:05:57] We also have 50% share in a vacation condo in Sarasota, Florida. Okay.

CLIENT2: [00:06:05] That’s great.

CLIENT1: [00:06:05] So vacations are more or less covered, although it does cost us minimal.

CLIENT2: [00:06:12] Yeah. Yeah. There’s no mortgage on it. It’s just.

CLIENT1: [00:06:15] Yeah. Maintenance or replacing furniture and stuff. Yeah. But so I’d say if I, if I could have. 24 thousands income, 12 from my Social Security benefit and 12 from my IRA. I’ll be happy.

ADVISOR: [00:06:36] Yeah. So so that’s the budget. So more or less per year, you need 24k to be happy as a couple.

CLIENT1: [00:06:42] Yes, yes. My well well, Jennifer, I have an IRA as well, so that would be okay. 36. 36.

ADVISOR: [00:06:50] But sorry, just to go back on the expenses as a household.

CLIENT1: [00:06:54] What do my household expenses? About 8000 per year.

ADVISOR: [00:06:59] 8000? Yeah. That’s low. Right. 8000 per year. Right. Yeah. Cool.

CLIENT1: [00:07:06] Yeah. It will be something like that.

ADVISOR: [00:07:08] It’s really low.

CLIENT1: [00:07:10] Is it?

ADVISOR: [00:07:10] Yeah. Yeah, it’s. It’s good. I mean.

CLIENT1: [00:07:13] I don’t have a mortgage.

ADVISOR: [00:07:14] Yeah, yeah, but it’s great.

CLIENT2: [00:07:15] We’re not. Although we’ve got the condo in Sarasota, Florida.

CLIENT2: [00:07:17] We’re quite.

CLIENT1: [00:07:18] That’s.

CLIENT2: [00:07:19] Yeah, we’re quite like, sort of, you know, we don’t spend a lot of money. Then we’re quite frivolous, aren’t we, with what we spend.

CLIENT1: [00:07:24] So what I mean by what I mean by the 8000, I mean expenses that I can’t avoid. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:07:31] Like exactly.

CLIENT1: [00:07:32] Property taxes, water & sewer bill, electricity. That’s not what.

ADVISOR: [00:07:37] So would you want? So that’s. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:07:38] That’s not what I spend.

ADVISOR: [00:07:40] So then then those 8K. Then, if you want to to be happy you would like as a household 24K per year.

CLIENT1: [00:07:50] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:07:50] Yeah. No. It’s good. There’s no right or wrong answer. It’s really personal.

CLIENT1: [00:07:55] Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:07:57] For me personally, that is not. Is that what you mean?

ADVISOR: [00:08:02] Well, as a couple. So what’s your retirement account, Jennifer?

CLIENT2: [00:08:06] Well, I’ve only got a very small account. I didn’t pay into my account like Jerome did. So my account would be. Did we work it out, Jerome? No. Is it 11?

CLIENT1: [00:08:17] No. So Jennifer’s account. She she hasn’t basically got a retirement account. She’s got. Well, she will have $10000 in a company four oh one kay, which we we intend just to take and pay the tax on in the first.

ADVISOR: [00:08:35] Okay. Yeah. Small pot.

CLIENT1: [00:08:36] Yeah. In the first tax year. Take the lot. Pay the tax. Claim it back. Because she’s not in the in the tax bracket And live on that. Jennifer’s going to live on that for the time between when we actually finish work and when she gets her Social Security benefit. Yes. So that will be 11 months from. So we retired December 31, 2025.

ADVISOR: [00:09:01] You will be 61.

CLIENT1: [00:09:03] No, we’ll be 65. Both of us. Jennifer will be 65.

ADVISOR: [00:09:07] Oh, you said you are 64. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I put 60. Yeah. So you’ll be 65 in December? Sorry. Yes.

CLIENT1: [00:09:14] No. Jennifer will be 65th in July. Yes. And I’ll be 65 in November next year. This year.

ADVISOR: [00:09:22] Yeah. Yeah. Yes. This year now.

CLIENT1: [00:09:24] Jennifer will have 11 months to be self‑sufficient before she can claim her Social Security benefit. Yes. Because that’s November 26th.

ADVISOR: [00:09:34] Six? Yes.

CLIENT1: [00:09:36] I’ll have about 18 months because I can’t claim mine until July 27th.

ADVISOR: [00:09:40] Yes. That’s okay, I think. I mean, with what I’ve seen, it’s fine. Yeah. And have you checked if you can get the full rate benefit? Have you done it?

CLIENT1: [00:09:48] Yeah. Yeah. We can both get the full Social Security benefit.

ADVISOR: [00:09:50] Superb. All right. So that’s that’s really good. And is the after‑tax portion that you are potentially able to get. Is there any aim or is just to use for retirement, i.e. savings. Or is there anything you are planning to do with it?

CLIENT1: [00:10:09] We’ve got 1 or 2 major, well not major, but bigger expenditure things that we want to do. Yeah. So one we’ve at the moment, we’ve both got a car. Yeah. We intend. Jennifer doesn’t want to drive after the end of next year. When she.

CLIENT2: [00:10:27] I’ll drive

CLIENT1: [00:10:28] She’ll drive. But yeah, we don’t want to.

ADVISOR: [00:10:30] I mean, they are expensive, so if you think you can share, it will be.

CLIENT1: [00:10:33] Yeah. So my car is old . We’re going to. So we’re going to buy a reasonable car that we share. Yeah. So we need to do that. Yeah. Jennifer’s car’s reasonably new, and it’s in good condition. We’re taking that to Sarasota, Florida. Leave it there.

ADVISOR: [00:10:53] Oh, that’s a good idea. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:10:54] So we don’t have to rent. Yeah. That’s.

ADVISOR: [00:10:57] What my my best friend’s parents do in Portugal. Yeah. We’ve got a house, and they. They drove one day just to leave the car. And so now it’s easier with the airport. And once they’re on site, it goes a couple of months a year.

CLIENT1: [00:11:10] Yeah. That’s what we’re going to do. Yeah. So then after that we want a little bit of work done in the garden, perhaps 5000. Yeah. And 1 or 2 small jobs on the house. Maybe a new bathroom. Another 5000 or something. Good. And then after that, we haven’t really got any massive expenditure. Things that we really can foresee other than we might want to go on a. So we do go to Sarasota all the time, obviously, because it doesn’t cost us just to get there, but we also like to go other places now and again.

ADVISOR: [00:11:43] Yeah, sure. Of course. And you should. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:11:46] Yeah. We were out West last summer, weren’t we?

ADVISOR: [00:11:50] Where did you go?

CLIENT1: [00:11:51] We went to from here. We went on the road. So we went to Denver and we had for an afternoon in Denver. That was lovely.

ADVISOR: [00:12:04] I like Denver.

CLIENT1: [00:12:05] Then we got Then we got the the drive down to. Is it Santa Fe?

ADVISOR: [00:12:09] Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:12:10] Yeah. And we stayed there for one night. That’s nice. We wish we’d have stayed there longer because we got there late on the evening, didn’t we? We stayed up past nine and we left at nine the next morning.

ADVISOR: [00:12:19] Oh, yeah, that was quick.

CLIENT1: [00:12:20] So we ran out quick. We went out in the town. It was lovely, isn’t it?

ADVISOR: [00:12:24] It’s beautiful and it’s quite dynamic.

CLIENT1: [00:12:26] Yeah. We got up early and had a look round, but obviously we didn’t have chance to like the plaza and that we didn’t get a chance to look at it. Then we went from there to Phoenix, didn’t. We had two nights in Phoenix. We went road down to Tampa, got a car and drove down to our condo, which is in Sarasota, Florida, in Gulf Gate.

ADVISOR: [00:12:46] So each time you drive to, you fly to Tampa normally?

CLIENT1: [00:12:49] No, we fly to TPA.

ADVISOR: [00:12:52] Okay. Super. That’s good.

CLIENT1: [00:12:53] Which is about 25 minutes from our house.

ADVISOR: [00:12:56] Okay. So that’s good. Savings. Is there anything? Do you have some other bits? Because if the budget has shown us something is if you want to be tax efficient, savings, then a Roth IRA is quite a good tool. So do you have any of that?

CLIENT1: [00:13:13] At the moment? Jennifer’s got some inheritance money, which is locked away until July. Yes. It’s been locked away for two years. And so we will put some of that into a Roth IRA and some probably into a. Yeah. High‑yield savings account. Yeah. When she.

ADVISOR: [00:13:29] How much is it more or less?

CLIENT1: [00:13:31] It’ll be 32.

CLIENT2: [00:13:33] It’ll be about 33 by the time July.

CLIENT1: [00:13:36] 32 - 33.

ADVISOR: [00:13:38] The reason why is I want to show you. I want to make a cash flow for you and show you what’s going to happen and how it’s going to look like. Okay. And a high‑yield savings account is great. And after the other bank account, and, you know, when you start to retire, what is is all about being tax efficient when you’re going to take all this money from this little pot, which I understand, it does make sense to do that. Then you use that, then you use whatever is left in the bank. Then you use the Roth IRA because it’s tax free. So whatever the interest you’re going to make out of that, you won’t pay anything out of this. Is there anything else in your side? Maybe.

CLIENT1: [00:14:15] No.

ADVISOR: [00:14:15] No. Cool.

CLIENT1: [00:14:16] We were going to say so. January. February. March 26. We intended on being self‑sufficient. Not touching this until April. Yeah, there’s.

ADVISOR: [00:14:26] I think it’s I don’t think you do need to do that. It depends. Also, if you can save a bit of money now while you are working after, you know, sometimes you’ve got plans and you just it’s just four months, you’re probably going to be okay, but it’s more about to see when savings are going to be used first and retirement accounts and all of that. So if we come back to your retirement accounts just to see how you you feel, you, I understand how much you want per year. So your pot. So this is an annuity. Do you know the annuity rate you get with that or not?

CLIENT1: [00:15:02] Well, that that one is the one that’s concerning me most, because I know it’s gone from a forecast of 2400 a year to 1400, and then it’s gone. Back up, back down, back up, back down.

ADVISOR: [00:15:15] A couple of rental duplexes in Chicago. I mean, don’t get me wrong, they all are different. But what’s happened is they seem to have stopped paying bonus into this guaranteed annuity account. And I did. Exactly. It’s really similar with a similar number as well. And what I understand is that on one of their papers, they said that the performance of some of the funds that were invested in haven’t done well. So that’s why the value went down. What is really important they don’t seem to have given you is really how much you will get. So the okay, three, 3000.

CLIENT1: [00:15:55] Yeah. But you see the one from only the year before, it was massively different.

ADVISOR: [00:16:00] Yeah. And so this one is so this one is doesn’t even give you this one doesn’t give you.

CLIENT1: [00:16:07] Hang on. Was it this one. No that’s not.

ADVISOR: [00:16:12] Did you see that those numbers are there. You could start to take it now this. Did you realize that.

CLIENT1: [00:16:19] Yeah I deferred it for a year. Okay.

ADVISOR: [00:16:22] Now you’ve told them another year.

CLIENT1: [00:16:24] Yeah. Okay. I, I did it some time ago.

ADVISOR: [00:16:27] That’s fine. I can have a look. What?

CLIENT1: [00:16:29] I didn’t want it want it now because no tax on it.

ADVISOR: [00:16:32] Exactly I agree.

CLIENT1: [00:16:36] I just

ADVISOR: [00:16:41] Well, the annuity.

CLIENT1: [00:16:42] Which one? It was.

ADVISOR: [00:16:43] So in your in your, in your ideal world. So this how much is, have you ever again I’m going to write it down, I’m going to tell you numbers because I’m just doing some quickly. Okay.

CLIENT1: [00:16:53] Just minimize that.

ADVISOR: [00:16:56] This one was about.

CLIENT1: [00:17:00] That’s close to 30.

ADVISOR: [00:17:04] I think you said 32. 59. I think it was 151. No.

CLIENT1: [00:17:18] 1567,60

ADVISOR: [00:17:22] 1567 Okay.

CLIENT1: [00:17:24] Okay.

ADVISOR: [00:17:26] So I just want to Quickly put some numbers together.

CLIENT1: [00:17:34] Oh, so at the minute I pay into a couple of these.

ADVISOR: [00:17:40] You don’t pay on that one.

CLIENT1: [00:17:42] Yeah, I pay $28.50 a month. Okay. That that’s that one.

ADVISOR: [00:17:47] Yeah. And this one?

CLIENT1: [00:17:48] That one. I was paying 4000 a year, but I just asked for it back. So the last two years, my salary increase went into there instead of to me. Yeah. But now I’ve taken it back for this year because I want some cash. Okay. But I still pay 5% and my employer pays three.

ADVISOR: [00:18:09] Okay.

CLIENT1: [00:18:10] Into that. And the Fidelity IRA one. I pay $300 a month into.

ADVISOR: [00:18:14] Okay. But this one is not your four oh one kay plan. No. Why don’t you stop paying in this one and pay in this one where you get tax relief and your—

CLIENT1: [00:18:24] Because this one’s not performing. Okay. It’s only. It’s only increased by the amount I paid in in the last four years. Okay. It’s not. It’s not made any money at all. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:18:36] So the Vanguard workplace four oh one kay. I moved my husband’s funds. Investment. You know, when you find out something, just, you know, you I mean, you could you could have. I mean, it’s done now, but you could change the funds.

CLIENT1: [00:18:48] Yeah, that’s where it’s invested in. Yeah, it’s it’s—

ADVISOR: [00:18:53] Well, cash retirement account. Of course it’s—

CLIENT1: [00:18:55] Because it’s my employer’s.

ADVISOR: [00:18:57] Yeah, you can change that. You could have change your—

CLIENT1: [00:18:59] where it’s invested.

ADVISOR: [00:19:01] You could.

CLIENT1: [00:19:02] Yeah. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:19:03] Yeah you could. I’ve changed my husband’s.

CLIENT1: [00:19:05] My advisor should have been doing that for me.

ADVISOR: [00:19:07] It’s okay. So I want to make you just have a thought about this. This technically, potentially, you can have. I don’t know, and I’m happy to have a look for you. You can have a guaranteed annuity rate that is supposed to be better. Last time I checked it was actually not better. But sometimes they are better. That’s the purpose of this policy. This one. And this one. At some point being. And by the way, you could do a partial transfer from that one to that one if you prefer that money. I don’t know how you invested all I want, all I’m going to say after we’re going to talk about it is we need to be aware of market volatility, because when we spoke, you actually mentioned this. You were unhappy about some of the volatility. Believe me, you don’t want to be in that situation next year. So this—this investments need to be the right investment for now. I know it’s in one year, but believe me the idea is not to try to make 50%. Well you can—some of the systematic withdrawal options we have, they still do good investment, but the idea is you still want to have a part of that cash that is really protected. So even if the market drops by 10 or 20 %, you can feel okay about it because you have half of the pot or like 40 % of the pot that is actually okay. Otherwise, you are not going to sleep at night. So to reach out to 12K potentially there’s this—I’m happy to have a look at how it looks like. Exactly. What are your annuity rates and what you could get on the back of this? I can compare it to a proper annuity quote from another provider, which I do all the time. So at least we see if we are competitive or not, because we could have a part of your retirement planning with one annuity and one set of systematic withdrawals. But how do you feel about systematic withdrawals? So the idea of it—

CLIENT1: [00:21:00] What I was thinking was until we start drawing our Social Security benefit in July 27th, we’ll keep it invested and take systematic withdrawals. Yeah. And then we may review it and think about an annuity then.

ADVISOR: [00:21:19] That’s a good plan. Yeah, but then definitely needs to be invested the right way because even that 45 % invested—if you want to buy an annuity in two years, but it’s invested and the market drops, you won’t be have the same amount. Now, what I’m doing is challenging you. It’s challenging the views and just people tend to forget that the market has been away, is going to be away. Like for example, at the end of the year, it’s—it’s normal. That used to be my job. It’s normal. End of the year, everybody closes the shop. The traders are not working too much. They don’t take risk because the book closed. And it’s only because beginning of the year, all the new finance, all the new deals are going to come in the market as the markets come back again. But the end of the year are usually a bit like lower. That’s normal. But that’s why also after the budget there was a bit more volatility. Trump went up. But then end of the year it always goes down because no one is doing anything on the market. You—it’s what is really important is to think that you can’t control the market. You can’t time it. You can’t know what’s going to happen. A new war could happen next year or new war could happen 27. A new Covid could happen. Covid was a really hard time. And when you think—when you look at the curve, it really went down 20 %.

ADVISOR: [00:22:35] People were taking systematic withdrawals or were invested the wrong way. They really suffered because depending on how you are invested, some of them, they came—they were like the ones we deal with, all the funds we deal with, most of them—they came back after 3 or 4 months to be positive again. Some of them—I sometimes I review some of the funds of the—of my clients—they haven’t only got back a year and a half after. Can you imagine if your money is invested in this? That’s really like—That’s terrible. You worked all your life for that money. So the idea is, I always say you’ve done well. You work all your life, you have invested your money, your retirement account has been working. Maybe not this one, as you said, but that one hopefully was working well for you. Now it’s the time to think about, yes, we’ve got the money, but that the money we’re going to live with now. So we don’t need that money to be at risk. We need a part at risk potentially, if we do systematic withdrawals. But when you want to buy an annuity, then we have a different way to look at it. When you buy an annuity it’s great. I mean I understand why people buy an annuity. It’s just it does remove some of the flexibility of saying, oh, let’s just take five grand from the pot and go to the Caribbean.

ADVISOR: [00:23:42] So treat yourself. Really, once you buy an annuity the money is used. There is no way back from it when—and that’s why I always say you can do a part of your retirement pot with an annuity because it gives you a secure income. And then you can do—look at systematic withdrawals with a percentage. And that’s why I will do the cash flow for you, to show you—of trying to get to your target—to show you, and making sure that the idea is it lasts for the rest of your life, really. But the—there is investment risk when you do systematic withdrawals because the part of the money is invested. We invest it in a—in a way, as I said, that half of it is almost not risky. Too much. Well, 15 % is not and then 35 % is almost not, but it’s a bit and the rest is a bit more. But it’s still under your risk profile because whoever is number four is a three out of five, four out of five, five out of five. We still put them on a three out of five. If they are looking to retire, it’s because at the end it’s the same speech. Why would you lose some money—especially, you have—there is no savings here so there is nothing to back you up. I don’t know if you are planning to downsize, but I don’t think so. You like your house? It’s a beautiful house.

CLIENT1: [00:24:52] So we thought about it, but we can’t find anything we like as much.

ADVISOR: [00:24:56] Yeah, and to be honest, you’ve got a pot of almost—Well, I did include that one just for now, because we will see what comes out when I do the research. But you’ve got 250 K there—when you look, when you think about systematic withdrawals, imagine we do the annuity with that part. But the other part we do systematic withdrawals. And you take 4 or 5 % per year. I need to look at the numbers to see how it would work out. As far as it’s sustainable and you can reach your objective and you have enough money for the rest—it doesn’t really matter. And it’s all about how you position your money. Really? Does that make sense?

CLIENT1: [00:25:31] Cause. The other thing with annuity I’d, I’d obviously take the after‑tax portion wouldn’t I?

ADVISOR: [00:25:38] Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:25:39] But, but what would I do with it? Just put it in a high‑yield savings account or whatever.

ADVISOR: [00:25:44] Yeah. It’s—

CLIENT1: [00:25:45] If I take systematic withdrawals that money is still making money. Exactly.

ADVISOR: [00:25:50] So—but after, you know it’s—So when you do systematic withdrawals, you can—I’m going to send you some videos over the weekend or on Monday where—I don’t know if you’ve seen our systematic withdrawals. Some people do the after‑tax withdrawal flows and they start the withdrawals. But you can also do 25 % after‑tax, 75 % taxable on each withdrawal. So you can mix and be more tax‑efficient—after‑tax withdrawal flow. You don’t have a mortgage. People usually take it to repay a mortgage or part of their mortgage, or they have some expenditure. As you said, you want to do something with the money to be honest, so it’s not like you’re not doing anything. But yes, whatever is left after you can put—So I’m going to remove the 59 K just in case. Okay. So you have around 47 K that is going to be come to you. You said 10 K here. You’re going to buy a new car—probably 20‑30 K—I don’t know what car you want, but it goes quick. 16. Yeah. Okay. So let’s say you got—you need 30 K so you’ve got 17 K left. That’s good. And then that’s just something you use on the side as—as you said for Jennifer—when she needs she’s going to use that first money. It doesn’t matter. It goes quick right. If you are planning to do this. So then you’ve got around 140 K to take systematic withdrawals from or buy an annuity. 140 K annuity. 140 K.

ADVISOR: [00:27:18] So, what am I doing with that pot she’s got? So it’s a lady who’s got a pot similar to you. And she’s going to buy an annuity. And that’s giving her five grand per year at the minute with that sort of pot. To give you an idea. So—If this one is 2 K, we are not there yet. You are at 7 K per year more or less. Systematic withdrawals—once I do the cash flow we can have a look together. We don’t have to take decision for now. I think if you allow me, I would like to research on each policy—what exactly you’ve got, how you are invested, what are the options out of both of them. More importantly, this one. And—and then when I do the cash flow and with your target see if that can work and how—what could be the best solution, really, I think. Do I think an annuity is great? But you just have to think that once you’re done, you’re done. It’s—there is no way to come out of that. So it’s just a disadvantage is a lack of flexibility. Systematic withdrawals, if you invest in the right way, it’s a really good flexible tool. And it’s also the most tax‑efficient way because at some point as a—as a household, you’re going to have around 24 K per year with Social Security benefit. Right. Which is not far. Wow. You—you agree with me, right? 12 K, 12 K. I mean, I’m rounding up the numbers.

CLIENT1: [00:28:46] 2 12s from the Social Security benefit.

ADVISOR: [00:28:49] Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:28:50] Plus whatever we get from my private money. Yes. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:28:53] But you told me you would like 22 to 24 K per year, so really quickly you were going to get 24 K per year just from Social Security benefit. Yeah. So the rest I will find it. Almost—I want—I need to make you do a questionnaire. I know you are—I think you are a lot more risky than an annuity. But an annuity is going to definitely force you to pay taxes on it all the time. While you don’t have to do when you do systematic withdrawals, it can be flexible so you don’t have to do it every month. You can do a lump‑sum withdrawal. So you can say—what kind of line—I want, I don’t know, like six grand this year. And you deal with that for a year, or you say, well, I want this every month. And then we realize it doesn’t work out. You can—you can do quite a lot. You don’t have to be fixed on the term you want. The gap is from really when you retire to having both Social Security benefit. But it’s nothing. As you said, I think it’s 18 months for you. It’s nothing—18 months. You will cover it probably with your after‑tax withdrawal, your inheritance money and all of that. So having systematic withdrawals—and I’m just sending ideas. So you guys gonna think about it. It’s just going to give you flexibility on top of a—of a potential annuity from someone. Yeah, it just annoyed—

CLIENT1: [00:30:11] So if we—if we went into systematic withdrawals, would the money is invested in various places or some of it, would you be reviewing that and changing it accordingly?

ADVISOR: [00:30:26] Yes. I’m going to make a little drawing, if that’s okay. And to be honest, I think I saw a drawing—I think I did it for another client I’m doing it for. So just so it’s—I’m going to—I didn’t bring anything today. I—it’s the first meeting is always about understanding what you would like. Second meeting—once I have all this information back, if that’s okay, I’ll come back with more and I will send you videos. You’re going to mature about different things. So imagine you’ve got a pot of—I said after after‑tax withdrawal around 140 K okay. And you took your ATW. So after‑tax withdrawal of 47. So that money is there. What I do—what we do—is that we do 15 % in cash. Cash into those retirement account providers. They are usually at the Federal Reserve rate. Rates are not far. So right now it’s 4.1 %. Most of the retirement account providers. So the cash is actually working. It’s 4 %. It’s not an investment, but it’s not like you’re not losing money out of it, if that makes sense. Inflation is not eating it at the moment. Then we’ve got around 35 % in what we say—I call it my kip, but it doesn’t matter too. So it’s a risk profile of two which is more or less cautious to moderate. So it’s a lot lower than you. It’s a—it’s—it’s someone who has—do you understand money market fund or do you have any—No it’s—

CLIENT1: [00:31:49] No really.

ADVISOR: [00:31:50] So more or less each of our mics and I’m—please if it’s completely—just tell me—but I won’t—I’m going to try to make it simple. So for each of those compositions there are three funds in it that we like and that funds—we monitor. Monitor them on a monthly basis. In those three funds, there is one that is a money market fund, more or less. It’s a cash fund. It’s the first year it’s 5 % and three and five years it’s usually 10 %. There is no risk on this one. It’s a money market fund. It’s—it’s—but it’s like a big cash savings account but a bit better. And then the two other funds are a bit more risky, but it’s a two risk profile. So if I show you some of the graph next time you will see that when things go down like this, when there are 4 or 5 out of five might just go a little more or less—when the things go up this way, a four out of five fund risk profile mine takes—it doesn’t go as up neither, because as part of it, they—they don’t react the same way negatively or positively. So the—the—how to say—the—the volatility is a bit more smoother. So it’s three funds in this that I will say, complete each other. And then the rest here—I think is around 50 %. I think it’s maybe a bit more, but it doesn’t matter. We put it in our kip three. So these are three funds. Again, a bit more risky than those. Those are here. Those are the money that we see more like medium or long term. Why? Because you’re going to use that money here first of all. So if I put some numbers a bit more for you, I hope—I just want you to understand. And I hope that doesn’t make it. 140 K.

ADVISOR: [00:33:45] So there will be 21 K here to give you an idea. 49 and 70 K. So this is available. So imagine you’re not even going to need a lot of money to start with, if I’m honest, because you’re going to have your after‑tax cash flow, a bit of savings. But worst case you just start to draw from this. Imagine out of those 18 months where you don’t have your Social Security benefit, you need 10 K. I’m going to go a bit bigger, but it’s available. You draw from it, then there’s still 5 K in it. This money, while it’s happening, it’s still working. It’s invested. It’s invested when you start. So usually it’s every three years we rebalance it, which might happen for you, but if not, we just do it before we move more money into the cash. Because one of the funds that I mentioned is the money market funds. So the money is really easy to move from. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t move much. It only goes up and small. So we move more money into the cash and more money here. So you always have money available, and so you always have money available in cash and the rest are invested. Usually we rebalance every three years because that’s the calculation that I will make. It’s how much you’re going to need.

ADVISOR: [00:35:12] But the idea is that part of the money is at risk, because that probably you won’t touch that money for another ten years. 15 years. Those investments they bring, our blend of funds is more doing like something like 15, 25%, 45%. Imagine you don’t touch that money for another 5 or 7 years. That money will have a lot more than once you start to draw from. So if you draw 4% but you have investments, that makes 20%. Actually, you haven’t even yet started to use your money because this money is making money. If that makes sense. And that’s why I don’t want to make it complicated. I’m really sorry because we are going into details for once. But the idea is it’s really important how the money is invested when you start to retire. And that’s most of the people that don’t really realize that. It’s because if your money is at risk, when you start to draw money and the market tanks and goes a lot lower than anyone thought or even you wanted, it’s not a really nice situation to be. But if you have the right position in with your funds and you have some money available now, so whatever happened with the market, it’s okay, you can wait, then you are okay. That’s all I will say about whatever you have done with your funds.

ADVISOR: [00:36:31] Is that okay? Does that make sense? Okay. So really you’ve got 18 months where you’re going to need a bit of money, then Social Security, as the two of you is going to be 24k, and then the rest is like extra. Maybe we do you do in this annuity. Maybe it’s Maybe it’s going to be a good one. Let’s be positive. Maybe it’s a good one. Maybe I’ll show you. It’s a really good thing. The only problem is that what’s it going to give us now, and when is it going to give us in? One year might change. So this is where you take a this is where a risk can be taken or not. And this is where you need to decide what do you do. Do you want to pay taxes for one year on something you know you’re going to get for the rest of your life? Or do you not want to do this? So you transfer it into a more policy like this? I think this is where you need to. This is what’s going to come out after. Once I have all the information where you need to decide, well, I will stay with Prudential because maybe their rate is good, but maybe I take it you.

ADVISOR: [00:37:34] I know you postpone it, but I can always be changed. It’s okay, I think. And then you tell them. Well, I’m going to take it now. Pays the taxes, put more money into your retirement account. It’s okay because an annuity doesn’t doesn’t change any of your retirement contribution limits. It doesn’t trigger anything. So imagine you start to get I think it was around one and a half k or two K per year. So let’s say you get $150, $200 more as an income to you. If you put more money into your retirement account you get tax relief on this. So actually it’s not a losing, it’s not a losing situation. Does that part make sense?

CLIENT1: [00:38:14] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:38:15] Yeah. Because it’s a risk as you said the fact is the more your pot will lose value and you don’t know how Prudential is going to do with this investment in the next year. It’s either if you want an annuity, either you do it now with them. Once I see the rates and I tell you compared to what’s out there, it will be good. And if not, do you want to wait one year and maybe see that pot lower, lower again, which I find it. It’s a bit well it depends. It depends what I found out when I look at the documents. Is that okay?

CLIENT1: [00:38:47] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:38:48] But I think that, that’s you know, I know you said, oh, I’m going to postpone it for another year, but now I’m saying it loud. The idea is, yeah, but it’s one year of tax. But then the tax, you can recycle it more as a retirement contribution into your salary. With your salary because it’s a small amount. So you just put $200 more into your retirement which is a good, good thing really.

CLIENT1: [00:39:10] I might do that with the money I’ve taken back from this.

ADVISOR: [00:39:14] So again, I mean, explain to me first.

CLIENT1: [00:39:17] Yeah. My work one. Yeah. The last two years I’ve paid my salary increase into there.

ADVISOR: [00:39:22] Which was a good idea, I think.

CLIENT1: [00:39:23] Yeah, but I asked my company now for from January.

ADVISOR: [00:39:27] Because you want cash you said. 

CLIENT1: [00:39:28] Give it me back because I was going to try and save some cash, but I might pay a little bit more into the Fidelity IRA.

ADVISOR: [00:39:35] You could.

CLIENT1: [00:39:36] Yeah. Hundred or 200.

ADVISOR: [00:39:38] Is it don’t match you. Right. Your company is. They only pay 3%. Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah. Then you get tax relief.

CLIENT1: [00:39:44] But they’re still pay three and I pay five. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:39:46] Yeah. Which is good. But I agree that when you are that close to retirement, because this money is available now to, you just need to get organized. But the money is available now. It’s not like me locking money away for 25 years. So it is. You are just being really tax efficient. So whatever you put, you’re going to get 20% back from it. Do it. That’s how to see. But would you let me have a look and tell you really quick. Yeah I’m going to get. 

[00:40:15] Because this one.  Oh there, there is, there is the figure somewhere. But I don’t know where I’ll put it. Is it on there? No, that’s that one. This one is really annoying me.

ADVISOR: [00:40:32] Yeah, I understand why. Because I would be. I’m going to ask them, but I’m pretty sure I’m going to get the information. Once I have the fund, I can have a.

CLIENT2: [00:40:39] Look through them. Which one is it?

ADVISOR: [00:40:41] The Prudential one.

CLIENT1: [00:40:42] No. What I’m looking for is. This. There you go. So this. Oh, this was April.

ADVISOR: [00:40:50] That’s okay.

CLIENT1: [00:40:51] So it’s gone worse since April. So just go back to this one for a minute. In January 23. So that’s two years ago. This was going to give me 8000 lump sum and 2007. No.

ADVISOR: [00:41:09] This one, he was giving you this.

CLIENT1: [00:41:10] Sorry. So sorry.

ADVISOR: [00:41:11] Yeah. No. It’s fine.

CLIENT1: [00:41:12] So 9000 plus. Three grand? Three grand.

ADVISOR: [00:41:16] A year. Per year? Yes.

CLIENT1: [00:41:19] In. This is six months later, April 24th. Yeah. So. Yes. That’s. What was that? December 20th? No, that was February 23.

ADVISOR: [00:41:30] Yes.

CLIENT1: [00:41:32] And April 24. Yeah. Well, you’re now giving me 1.4 basic. So it’s giving me two. Three. So that’s giving me a lump sum of four. And. So that’s a lump sum of seven. So that’s dropped 2000. Yes. Yeah. And what was the that one.

ADVISOR: [00:41:54] So this number 2.6.

CLIENT1: [00:41:55] So yeah two six instead of three. And it’s gone even worse since then. And now and now it’s 59,000 and not 61 and not 71. And I can’t find the piece that goes with that, but I will. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:42:15] So yeah. So it’s invested in one of the highest profit funds which I’ve seen and it’s not amazing.

CLIENT1: [00:42:23] That’s February 24.

CLIENT2: [00:42:27] You had it out earlier.

CLIENT1: [00:42:29] I can’t find that to a piece that goes with that. Is that it? That’s it. No that’s July 23. Yeah. I can’t find the actual piece that goes with that, but it’s rubbish.

ADVISOR: [00:42:48] No, but then it doesn’t make sense what I’m saying now. So I’m going to see what I find out. I’m going to make it so. Have you heard about a transfer‑authorization form? You probably have done this with another financial advisor, where you give me the right to ask the provider for information. I’m not doing anything. I’m just asking information so I understand.

CLIENT1: [00:43:04] It’s not changing. 

ADVISOR: [00:43:06] Nothing.

CLIENT1: [00:43:06] You’re not changing my advisory at this point.

ADVISOR: [00:43:09] No, no, no, I’m not changing anything. I’m asking you for permission. Yeah, so that’s what I get. All I get is everything about this and all the others, if you would like to.

CLIENT1: [00:43:16] But if I do decide to change from summit and oak financial to you.

ADVISOR: [00:43:21] Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:43:22] Then write to me saying you’re now my financial financial advisor.

ADVISOR: [00:43:25] Yeah, but we’re not there yet. You don’t need to do anything.

CLIENT1: [00:43:27] Yeah, okay.

CLIENT2: [00:43:28] That’s it.

CLIENT1: [00:43:31] No, that’s January 23 paper.

ADVISOR: [00:43:37] No. Right now we’re not changing anything. Okay?

CLIENT1: [00:43:39] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:43:40] Would you mind to fill one of those with your information? I do have your address. I have your telephone number. I’ve got your email. What I want is, I would like is your date of birth, Social Security number. So those two.

CLIENT2: [00:43:56] Can I get you a coffee or tea or a cold drink?

ADVISOR: [00:43:59] A glass of water would be lovely.

CLIENT2: [00:44:01] Yeah. Ice?

ADVISOR: [00:44:01] That’s okay. No, no, just tap and tap water.

CLIENT2: [00:44:04] Tap water. Thank you. Jerome, do you want a drink?

CLIENT1: [00:44:06] Yeah. Could I have a coffee?

CLIENT2: [00:44:08] Yes. Of course.

ADVISOR: [00:44:14] Yeah, it’s quite It’s quite a lot. It’s quite a lot. Big loss of value, to be honest. Yeah. Okay. And. No, I’ll have it if you want. Don’t. Don’t bother. I’ll do this. And so this. I can do it. But if you don’t, if can I. Yeah. So I take this account number.

CLIENT1: [00:44:36] Yeah. I’ll put that away.

ADVISOR: [00:44:38] 6921200. Sorry. Are you okay to do we do the whole exercise that I do with any clients, and we look at all the retirement accounts. So like this, when I come back, you have a clear picture of. Exactly. So the Vanguard workplace four oh one kay. May I take your account number? Yeah. Okay.

CLIENT1: [00:45:27] And one thing I didn’t ask you. Your fees would be?

ADVISOR: [00:45:32] Oh, I thought I sent you. It’s what we are. 1.5%. But, right now I don’t even know. I’m gonna give you my advice. I said I send it to you last time.

ADVISOR: [00:45:41] Thank you. But for now, I don’t really know yet what we’re going to do. So I give you my paper. It’s 1.5% minimum. 750. It does bother me that you have already paid so many fees to your financial advisor. So maybe we have a conversation about this. But anyway, for now, we are not there.

CLIENT1: [00:45:59] Thank you.

ADVISOR: [00:46:01] Would you mind to put your Fidelity IRA account number?

CLIENT1: [00:46:05] Yeah. There we are. Thank you.

ADVISOR: [00:46:12] Thank you.

ADVISOR: [00:46:18] How many kids do you have?

CLIENT1: [00:46:20] Two. Grown up. We have five grandchildren. As you can see.

ADVISOR: [00:46:29] Wow. Nice.

CLIENT1: [00:46:30] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [00:46:34] They’re all babies?

CLIENT1: [00:46:36] No, no. The oldest is 12.

ADVISOR: [00:46:38] Okay. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [00:46:39] Then we have.

ADVISOR: [00:46:40] That one. No, no, she’s not 12.

CLIENT1: [00:46:43] This one’s. She’s now nine. And we have a 12. A ten and nine. A four and a two.

ADVISOR: [00:46:54] That’s cool. That’s good.

CLIENT1: [00:46:55] Yeah. The two year old was two on New Year’s Eve.

ADVISOR: [00:46:59] Oh, yeah. I’ve got two babies. Two and a half and one and a half.

CLIENT1: [00:47:05] Oh, lovely.

ADVISOR: [00:47:06] Yes.

CLIENT1: [00:47:07] Keep you busy, then.

ADVISOR: [00:47:08] You. Yeah. I’m not gonna lie. Yeah. Would it be okay for me to connect to your Wi‑Fi? So I just

CLIENT1: [00:47:18] You need the password.

ADVISOR: [00:47:19] Yes. Let’s do one thing first.

CLIENT1: [00:47:22] Yeah. Okay. It’s a bit complicated, so it’s the at sign.

ADVISOR: [00:47:30] So which one?

CLIENT2: [00:47:32] Go.

CLIENT1: [00:47:32] As in Oh, it’s Let’s have a look. Yeah, the octopus 5G. That’s it.

ADVISOR: [00:47:42] You want to type your password? I don’t need to know it. Oh.

CLIENT1: [00:47:46] Okay.

ADVISOR: [00:47:49] My Christmas tree didn’t Didn’t last. Well, it had to go down. Yours is not bad. Still,

CLIENT2: [00:47:58] We get asked from Do you know Madison very well? If you go up towards County Courthouse circle in Madison specially, which is just the circle opposite, we always go there to a tree farm outside Madison every year and they’re fantastic. And it lasts such a long time. It’s I don’t think we’ve, I think we’ve put water in the, you know, the little pot which comes with it probably twice in the in the weeks we’ve had it.

ADVISOR: [00:48:23] But. Oh we didn’t do that. So I have to say we, I’ve always done a plastic Christmas tree with my husband. We said no, let’s do a proper tree. He got the tree well while I was away. And I didn’t even know this, so I knew for next year. Yeah, that’s the trick.

CLIENT2: [00:48:40] We’ve got the the actual stand which we got from there a few years ago. So you just put a little bit of water just to sort of, you know.

ADVISOR: [00:48:47] Yeah, I think we, I think we have the same one as a little pot. Yes. Yeah. All right. Tell him next time.

CLIENT2: [00:48:53] It’s right next to the fire, as you can see. So it gets quite warm in there. And it’s lasted really well isn’t it. Yeah. It’s coming down on Sunday, but we get is it Saint Richards Hospice where we get, you know, just donate the money and they come and collect it each year.

ADVISOR: [00:49:08] Oh, no. I was wondering how the money is a bit smaller, so. Yeah, I’m going to check.

CLIENT2: [00:49:13] Yeah. I think you’ve just registered. You know.

CLIENT1: [00:49:17] The minimum donation is $27 or something.

CLIENT2: [00:49:20] If your tree is not that big.

CLIENT1: [00:49:22] But the thing is, it’s for charity.

ADVISOR: [00:49:23] Yes. Right. Which is good.

CLIENT2: [00:49:26] I mean, we could take it to the recycling. The recycling place in Milford Road, but it’s getting in the car and I can’t. It isn’t that big.

ADVISOR: [00:49:34] I’m not going to lie. I don’t know if my husband really wants to put the tree in his car. Yeah, exactly.

CLIENT2: [00:49:39] Yeah. If he put it in his car, it’ll still be there in, you know, a couple of months time, or the pines would be dropping, wouldn’t it? Yes, yes.

ADVISOR: [00:49:46] Yeah. Do you find your policy number?

CLIENT1: [00:49:48] I’m just going to log on to it now. Sorry.

ADVISOR: [00:49:53] Yeah. It’s it is a bit sad, but it was it was really cool to do this. Yeah. So I said to her, I was saying to Jerome, I’ve got two babies. I see you are busy with the grandkids, but I’ve got a twin and a one and a half.

CLIENT2: [00:50:05] Oh, gracious.

ADVISOR: [00:50:06] Yes.

CLIENT2: [00:50:07] Well, I’ve just. Yeah, we’ve just had my daughter and her husband and the three children living with us because they moved into a new house.

ADVISOR: [00:50:15] Yeah. Oh, yeah.

CLIENT2: [00:50:17] Yeah. Three days before they were due to move in.

ADVISOR: [00:50:19] Yes.

CLIENT2: [00:50:20] He has a phone call from the estate agent to say the neighbour, which had been going in and checking on it, had gone in to check on it. Water cascading through the ceiling. They had a burst pipe in the bathroom, so they lost half of the ceiling in the one room, and all the everything was flooded. So that was three days before they were due to move in. Of course, they’d already exchanged contracts.

ADVISOR: [00:50:45] So I mean, yeah.

CLIENT2: [00:50:50] So they came to live with us.

ADVISOR: [00:50:53] How was that?

CLIENT1: [00:50:54] difficult.

ADVISOR: [00:50:58] Well, I changed the dynamic, that’s for sure. Excuse me. I mean, I went to my parents the beginning of December for a bit of a fresh air, and I took my two kids, and it was a bad week. One was teasing and one was a bit of a pain, and the sleep was horrendous, I’m not going to lie. And my poor parents, I mean, they will never show or say anything, but I felt really bad. I felt really bad.

CLIENT2: [00:51:22] Luckily they are Absolutely excellent sleepers. I mean, they would go to bed. They go to bed at 7:00. And, you know, they’re still there at 7:00 the next morning. Oh, Mary, in fact, she’s she was just two on New Year’s Eve when my daughter rang me this morning, it was 9:00, and I said the children, she said, no. Edith and Mary were still in bed, which, I mean, that was 14 hours for Mary. And I said, she’s only two. That’s amazing. You know, so they are very they’re very.

ADVISOR: [00:51:52] Very, very.

CLIENT2: [00:51:53] Good sleepers.

ADVISOR: [00:51:54] Oh that’s.

CLIENT2: [00:51:55] Cool. It’s yeah, it’s quite ironic because.

ADVISOR: [00:51:57] They go to bed.

CLIENT1: [00:51:58] At seven don’t they. Yeah.

CLIENT2: [00:51:59] Every mother my daughter. So the mother of these three, these three children did not sleep until she was seven.

ADVISOR: [00:52:08] Is that possible? Yeah. No, no, literally.

CLIENT2: [00:52:11] She did not sleep.

CLIENT1: [00:52:12] Oh, yeah. She was.

CLIENT2: [00:52:13] She was. If I could.

ADVISOR: [00:52:16] I should ask you the question. But I find it easier if you take your time and read it yourself, you will.

CLIENT2: [00:52:20] Know she didn’t she didn’t sleep. Sleep was not something she. She did. She could function without sleep.

ADVISOR: [00:52:26] Yeah, some kids do that. She and that.

CLIENT2: [00:52:27] That was her. Okay. And we moved from our house we were in when she was little. And my other daughter would sleep 24/7, so she wasn’t very popular with my other daughter. So but then when we moved, my brother in law gave her this, this, like, firm talking to you, right? This is your bedroom. Now, I’ve just put all these wardrobes in. You’re going to sleep in there. And literally, she slept, but she did not know she was a she was not somebody that you would want as a sleepover.

ADVISOR: [00:52:56] I can’t completely complain. My my my daughter works and she’s fine. She’s she’s been always a good sleeper. But for some reason I moved them quite a lot in December. And I think it triggers something where she would wake up in the night and wanted to go in bed. And because I was not in my house, I took her sometime in the bed and I think it became a habit. So yesterday was the first night since probably 5 or 6 weeks she stayed in her bed because I started to be a bit like I started to be a bad mum. I mean, a hard mum because I need to sleep. Really? Each time I don’t sleep, then I’m sick or I’ve got a cold or. So we are back with stickers. I even close the door at some point saying if you don’t actually stay in your bed, I’m going to lock the door, so it’s up to you. So I think we’re going to. She was always a good sleeper and she was in bed until eight this morning. So we are going to get back to this madness. Is is one and a half. He looks like a two and a half kid. He is huge. And he can still ask for a bottle. That’s when I decided that it’s going to stop now because it’s comfort. It’s crazy. And the last two nights, I was honestly sure that he would sleep through and he didn’t. And I’m like, this is my language. This is bullshit because you had so much food. You are full. It’s just a habit. So now it’s done. So I did let him cry for an hour, which was terrible. But I need to do it because I know he doesn’t.

CLIENT2: [00:54:19] Yeah, I think probably reflection. I think that’s probably where we went wrong. You know, she came into bed with us and that’s where she stayed, because my other daughter would have quite happily threw her through the window. I think if she was, you know, she was somebody that slept, like I said, 24/7. And she would have quite easily, you know, it’s.

ADVISOR: [00:54:36] Hard, though. It’s really hard. And I find that sleep is really an important thing.

CLIENT2: [00:54:40] And sleep deprivation is awful, isn’t it?

ADVISOR: [00:54:43] Oh, gosh. Yeah. It’s Yeah.

CLIENT2: [00:54:47] Yeah, they’re challenging, aren’t they? But no, to be fair, it wasn’t. It wasn’t too bad. As I said, you know, they they were good sleepers. So they went up to bed and it’s good.

ADVISOR: [00:54:56] It’s just I guess it does break the routine when you have more people in your house and different.

CLIENT2: [00:55:03] And they were at school as well. So, you know, it wasn’t as if, you know, they were here all day. They were at school. So and my daughter goes to work. So it wasn’t too bad. I’m glad they’ve gone. Yes.

ADVISOR: [00:55:15] Yeah. Everything is good for a little while, I know.

CLIENT2: [00:55:18] But I’m just literally like today. This morning, I found handprints.

ADVISOR: [00:55:22] All over this.

CLIENT2: [00:55:23] Bed. So, you know, there’s still Mary bits of Mary here and everywhere. So but yeah. So they’re all yeah, they’re all dotted around somewhere around the walls.

ADVISOR: [00:55:32] Protect my. Yeah. Peter will try to touch everything in this room, so my mom had to put everything up. Oh. Bless her. I mean, she had four kids. She knows, but it’s still like, you know, she has done it. And I think five days. Six days was, you know, it’s good into your.

CLIENT2: [00:55:47] Own routine as well. I mean, you know, we’re used to, you know, sort of like just anything that you’re not used to having children around you.

ADVISOR: [00:55:56] I agree, I agree, and it’s it’s just Yeah, but yeah, it’s we’re gonna get there, but yeah, sometimes I’m like, whoa, I did I more or less decided we decided to have kids really close to to each other because professionally, it made sense at that time. I mean, I know you understand. So we did. But it’s true that sometimes we’re like, we could have waited two years, but we were in it.

CLIENT2: [00:56:22] So Harry’s four and Mary’s two. So, you know, there’s like, what, two and a bit years between them. But yeah, it’s.

ADVISOR: [00:56:31] For you two. And to be honest, it’s still really close to you. They are really close to each other.

CLIENT2: [00:56:34] Yeah. Harry, Harry and Mary are very close. So, you know, she’ll sort of, you know, get in with his games and he with her. So.

ADVISOR: [00:56:41] Yeah, that’s. So which Kroger do you work to?

CLIENT2: [00:56:46] No, no. Saint Peter’s. That’s a nice big one.

ADVISOR: [00:56:49] That’s the one we. My husband likes to go shopping. Yeah. You’ve been there for a long time?

CLIENT2: [00:56:54] It’s strange because I started with the Warden Kroger’s when my children were little when they first opened. And while they were sort of, you know, at school, they. That was ideal. And then I left after. I don’t know, it must have been about six years or so and I went to work for Specsavers Opticians. So I was there for just 20. I think I would have done 21 years. And then I left there a few years ago and I’ve gone back to Kroger. Okay. But yeah, so nothing really exciting.

ADVISOR: [00:57:28] Customer services is a hard work to be honest. Yeah, yeah it is I think especially especially in that field. You are. Yeah. It’s really everybody you are dealing with. Yeah. For probably different little problems sometimes. But you’re the.

CLIENT2: [00:57:43] One that get a shout.

ADVISOR: [00:57:44] Out. Oh, you definitely will. Yeah. Yeah, I’m afraid you will. And you would like, are you going to retire at the same time?

CLIENT2: [00:57:53] Yeah I think. Yeah. Yeah, I will.

ADVISOR: [00:57:56] Yeah. You should.

CLIENT1: [00:57:57] Yeah, I will.

ADVISOR: [00:57:57] You can do it. Yeah. With that. It’s okay. It’s just

CLIENT2: [00:58:00] No, it’s not that. It’s. I can’t see myself not, you know, not not sort of going out and socialising and, you know, being that person who talks all day long, which is what I do.

ADVISOR: [00:58:14] You might do different. Something different. Something different. I have some clients who do some voluntary work. Or still. Oh, you know, you could go even more part time and just keep one day and still work. It doesn’t. You don’t. It’s really how you feel. Really? Some people like to keep a, as you say, like this. Social contacts. This is still actually good to work.

CLIENT2: [00:58:34] Yeah. Yeah, that’s that’s one thing. But then like we said, you know, you’ve got that that you’ve got to book vacation at work because you want to go to Sarasota, Florida and you want to spend more time down there and it’s. Yeah, I know I’ll do it. I’m sure I’ll be fine.

ADVISOR: [00:58:47] I’ll soon be fine. In worst case, you find some, like association or charity or things you can just help out. You work all your life, so if it’s. Yeah. Yeah, it would be nice. How long have you had this condo in Sarasota?

CLIENT2: [00:59:02] 20. Yeah, 21 years in September.

ADVISOR: [00:59:05] Such a good idea.

CLIENT2: [00:59:06] Yeah. Yeah, it’s.

ADVISOR: [00:59:08] It’s lovely. Are you at the stage where you almost know some people there that goes often or local. So yes.

CLIENT2: [00:59:15] Yeah. Yeah. We’ve we’ve got there’s a lot of people that bought the same time as us, which sadly aren’t there anymore. Oh, you know, whether, you know, it was selling up and coming back home or sadly, you know, passed away. Yeah. So there is still, you know, there’s there’s only 38 of us on our little complex.

ADVISOR: [00:59:35] That’s good.

CLIENT2: [00:59:36] It’s very typically Floridian where we are. Good. We’ve got, you know, quite a few sort of houses around us. There’s a little school by us. Nice little town square with a nice big church. And so it’s it’s grown over the 20 years. The the area where we are. So, yeah, we’ve still got, you know, there’s, there’s a lot of people we know.

ADVISOR: [00:59:57] Know, but it’s nice when you go somewhere like this. I find because we, my parents have a place on the coast in Maine, and I go there since I’m a kid, and the. I like the idea that first I know where I go, so I know all the local bakery in coastal Maine, restaurants or whatever, and the beach is just next by. But also there’s always some people there that I will know that are either they live all year long there, or because I know some people are going to come from holidays or anything. I find it really nice. Yeah, yeah.

CLIENT2: [01:00:26] Yeah. My my sister, she literally came back last night. She went for just after Christmas and we had, you know, a boiler break down over there. So the neighbour which has been there quite a long time, you know, he, he’s the handyman who does everything. So of course he’s there to call upon and the next door. But one neighbour. Yeah. She’s there who we all know. And when the children go, my eldest daughter takes the six weeks holiday there. So she and her husband and the children go.

ADVISOR: [01:00:54] So if you’re making the most out of that. Yeah that’s great.

CLIENT2: [01:00:57] Yeah they do. And then the other daughter goes just before they go. So if there’s I don’t know if there’s a Sunday roast, which you know, which my daughter is very, very fond on doing it. And there’s no sort of, I don’t know, gravy granules in the cupboard next door, but one would be around with the gravy. So it’s a it’s quite a friendly little.

ADVISOR: [01:01:15] That’s good.

CLIENT2: [01:01:15] You know, it is nice. And you know, some of the bars which we go to and, you know, the restaurants.

CLIENT1: [01:01:21] I don’t know if I’ve missed something because they won’t let me finish.

ADVISOR: [01:01:25] Oh, and how is your Spanish?

CLIENT2: [01:01:28] Oh, mucho poco.

ADVISOR: [01:01:30] Was the first question you didn’t answer. Oh, I think that’s why. Yeah.

[01:01:35] Yeah. Jerome’s is very good at you know, sort of getting. Yeah. Because you studied it for a little while at college, didn’t you? So.

CLIENT1: [01:01:44] A little bit. So I’m not good. I tried to learn.

CLIENT2: [01:01:47] Yeah. But you, I think, you know, you get by.

ADVISOR: [01:01:49] Yeah. Yeah, you get by. I studied Spanish as well, and I’m really good. If I start to drink sangria.

CLIENT2: [01:01:54] Haha

CLIENT1: [01:01:55] That’s it

ADVISOR: [01:01:56] So sweet. Okay. Can I read quickly the summary, and I go back to summary after you are prepared to take a moderate amount of investment risk in order. And by the way, the risk profile in question are always a bit different from one company to company. And even if you are four in my company, I will not invest you as a four for retirement. You are prepared to take a moderate amount of investment risk in order to increase the chance of achieving a positive return. Capital protection is less important to you than achieving a better return on the investment. The typical moderate investor will usually invest in a variety of assets to obtain diversification, which is good. There will be a substantially higher proportion of equities for performance and property fixed income compared to fixed interest and cash. The range of asset types helps reduce the overall risk as well as increasing the chance of better returns. So you are what we call a three out of five is greater than moderate. It’s like you are able you are willing to take a bit of risk, but you are also cautious and understand the that’s part of that. Money needs to be in fixed interest and cash which is usually a good word, is what we like for systematic withdrawals.

ADVISOR: [01:03:07] To be fair, we just give me a benchmark. Even if you were higher, I will not invest you higher. Anyway, so it doesn’t matter. Thank you for that. Right. So just to explain a bit more, this paper, this transfer‑authorization form, which I’m going to send to each provider just for information, nothing else. Yeah. Usually they take 2 to 3 weeks to come back with all the questions I’m going to ask them. And what I do is once I start to see that I’m getting everything, I send you an email and we can see when I can come back on the back of that, I’m going to send you some videos live just in case you want to read, especially the systematic withdrawals if you want to watch again, something about systematic withdrawals and you know the different options you could have. I think what would be good for you is to think about what we said about that one. Depending on what I find out, if an annuity rate is actually really good, Then maybe we take it now and you pay taxes on this, but then you increase your retirement account contribution. So like this I mean, the pot is not anymore at.

CLIENT1: [01:04:10] Oh, I was going to say I should have took it then shouldn’t I? I couldn’t, this one.

ADVISOR: [01:04:16] It’s okay.

CLIENT1: [01:04:16] When it was at that rate I should have took it then, but I couldn’t.

ADVISOR: [01:04:20] But you didn’t know so you would it was going to go down.

CLIENT1: [01:04:23] I couldn’t have took it anyway.

ADVISOR: [01:04:24] No. Probably not. You could, but you would not have been the same numbers. You are in an age where you can do everything you want, retirement‑account‑wise, but the numbers are showing. You were on that normal retirement date. But that’s okay. It would have been a year lower. It would have been lower. You don’t regret. You never knew you. I would not have expected this. Even myself, if I’m honest. But that’s why it’s important to keep this in mind. You’ve seen what can happen and how you feel about it. How would you feel if it’s Fidelity or Vanguard? So it’s how you. It’s this investment feeling that you need to understand and see. Well, I’m going to retirement. This is my is my retirement money. I don’t want this annuity. Systematic withdrawals, how do we how do we do it? But the point is, just have a think about this. It’s okay to pay taxes on something we secure than in something we don’t, we are not happy. If the annuity rate is not good. We’ve got two options and that’s what we do. Either we move the money and we buy an annuity because you decide you want an annuity. And then we we don’t have to buy an annuity now, but we don’t know where the annuity rate is going to be now compared to next year. It’s linked to the Federal Reserve rates as if they’re going to fall a little more, but then they’re going to stay where it is, which means it’s going to fall a little more and then they’re going to stay where they are. So whatever you can get now, maybe you won’t get as much as in one year.

ADVISOR: [01:05:48] So it’s also another conversation. If you want an annuity. There’s different products we can do now where. Well I come back to that. But the options are. If we find out that it’s a bad annuity rate, either we say, well, we don’t do this now, but we move the money from that retirement account fund and we put it whenever I find out and we decide where we either don’t barely invested because you think, well, in one year I might not invest it, or we buy an annuity or we buy an annuity with someone else straight away. So if that makes you feel good, you already have this secure because you’re in your head. You already think that it’s going to be there. So it’s about how do we move that money into a different place if we were deciding. But again, it’s really important to know that the annuity rates won’t be the same now and in one year, if we can always, always can say that the 60 K, we put it into a safe account, and in one year we buy an annuity back on premise, which rate is going to be. That’s the only thing I Missing. I need to check with one provider. Sometimes they can lock a rate for a certain time, but I don’t know if they can do it for one year. I think it’s less. But anyway. That one. Yeah, it needs to be to be so true about what we’re going to do with that. Okay. But give me a couple of weeks once I have everything and then we we have a chat a bit more. Does that make sense? Yeah. Do you have any other questions?

CLIENT1: [01:07:22] No. Don’t think so.

ADVISOR: [01:07:24] Are things a bit more clearer in some way of i.e. what could be done? How? What needs to potentially get changed? What whatever can be done?

CLIENT1: [01:07:36] Yeah, I think so, yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:07:41] Well, if you have questions, to be honest, you can just email me. This I said it over the weekend. So at least we get the ball going. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:07:51] Okay. So do you think the Fidelity IRA one at the moment is that in too riskier.

ADVISOR: [01:07:57] Can I see how you’re invested? I didn’t see the funds. Yeah. I mean, I know quite a lot of funds. I don’t know if I’m going to know all of them, but. That’s what I will find out, by the way, with this form. I mean, I’m asking you a question that I’m going to get the answer really quickly from Fidelity.

CLIENT1: [01:08:16] Where it’s invested.

ADVISOR: [01:08:17] Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yes. A lot of clients, sometimes they come. Oh. That’s okay. Sorry about this. So is it like to tell me. Yeah, I’m putting money into my retirement account, and that’s great. Where are you invested? I have no idea. Okay, well, that’s actually the most important part. It’s good to put it somewhere, but.

CLIENT1: [01:08:43] Like me, I know where who it’s with. But where?

ADVISOR: [01:08:48] What? It’s normal.

CLIENT1: [01:08:50] I mean, what funds? I haven’t got a clue. And it wouldn’t mean anything to me to me if I did.

ADVISOR: [01:08:55] That’s why it’s good to have a chat.

CLIENT1: [01:08:57] But so is that.

ADVISOR: [01:09:00] I should explain.

CLIENT1: [01:09:01] That. Yeah. Is this what you need to see? This A bit?

ADVISOR: [01:09:06] Can I see this asset allocation? Investment maybe specified. So you are in retirement portfolio? Pre‑retirement, my investments. I want just here. Just. Yeah. That one. Can I click on that little Accumulation. Accumulation building. So this that’s a tracker. That’s good if you don’t. How many fund do you have? What is. Everything is up. Most of the things are up. Right. It’s a it’s a big list of fund. I’m surprised how much you’ve got exposure to Asia. I saw Japan here. I saw Pacific here. Well, this is cash. I thought gilt is good for emerging markets. That’s volatile. This is. This usually brings income. There’s a lot of tracker which more or less follow the index. This is what I don’t like. It’s a lot of funds. It would be really once I do the analysis it will be interesting how much charges each funds are. The tracker are cheap. This was all the funds. But you know, when you speak with this financial advisor, you have. You mentioned you when you did all the changes you wanted to. You said you wanted to. You said you you told them you wanted to retire on December 25. But did you mention you wanted to systematic withdrawals maybe or anything like this?

CLIENT1: [01:11:16] Well, he initially started off by saying we should be looking at systematic withdrawals. Then he seemed to change his mind and said we should be looking at annuity.

ADVISOR: [01:11:31] It’s two different product really is probably how he has felt with the conversation with you. You did say something to me earlier where you were like I’m thinking like this to use annuity if you say it’s how you feel about your investment. That’s what I said. I don’t think it is necessarily the best tool for you personally, especially if you do one already with a little pot, because once you both have the Social Security benefit, the the amount of money you need behind as a household is not huge. So the percentage of systematic withdrawals you need on an annual basis or monthly basis, it’s not huge. You see what I mean?

CLIENT1: [01:12:18] And go back to what I originally said about what I had in my head. Yes. If you said to me today, I can guarantee you from these three investments, I can guarantee you 12 grand a year for the rest of your life. I’d snap your hand off. Probably, yes. If you said to me if you went for systematic withdrawals, I could get you 14, maybe more a year. I’d probably take that gamble. And if you said to me, if you went for systematic withdrawals, I could probably get you 5 or 600 a year more. I’d still go for the annuity.

ADVISOR: [01:13:00] Yeah, okay. That’s why you think. That’s why you say it’s because you you actually want you want something a bit fixed. So maybe that is your product. It’s okay. We can this is this is a conversation to have. What is important is that that money doesn’t drop because buying an annuity in one year is it’s a really.

CLIENT1: [01:13:20] If I thought I had 12,000 and I was missing out on two a year or more, I’d be peeved. But if I had 12 grand fixed and I thought I could have got 5 or $600 more or a thousand, I wouldn’t be so bothered.

ADVISOR: [01:13:37] Yeah, I see.

[01:13:38] if you, if you are with me.

ADVISOR: [01:13:40] Yeah, I do, I do.

CLIENT1: [01:13:42] So as I was saying to saying to Jennifer recently. The reason I even the guy I got now. Daniel. Lovely person. I like the guy. He’s all right, you know. But the reason I’m exploring other options, such as you, is because if if I feel comfortable with my final decision, I’ll live with that, and I’ll be happy with it. So, like I said, if if I get 12 and I feel happy with it and I think they’re giving me decent advice, I’ll be happy. But if I think I could have got 2000 more, yeah, it’ll eat away at me for the rest of my days. Yeah. So but if I thought, you know, I could have got 500 more, I won’t bother, you know, I’ll be happy. So whatever decision I make come this time next year, I’ve got to feel happy with it, otherwise it’ll eat away at me. If that makes sense. Exactly.

ADVISOR: [01:14:49] With the size of that total pot, you will never get an annuity of 12K. That’s. It’s not. We need more money for that. For what i’m running now. So an annuity would never give you 12 kay per year. What we could do with this entire part is probably like if we include that one, for example, as I said, I think it’s around six, six and a half K. I mean you mentioned it’s got some quotes. How much did you get the annuity at that time? Well, just out of curiosity, I mean, the rates have changed if it was,

CLIENT1: [01:15:24] This is a little unfair because it gave Jennifer 100 % of my pot if I died.

ADVISOR: [01:15:31] You find it unfair?

CLIENT1: [01:15:33] Well, we wouldn’t want to do that. Not 100 %.

ADVISOR: [01:15:37] Because that’s your decision.

CLIENT1: [01:15:38] Because doesn’t that make a massive difference to difference to what we get now.

ADVISOR: [01:15:42] Oh any any criteria does impact. But you can do quotes. We can I can show you quotes for each. It doesn’t matter.

CLIENT1: [01:15:49] If we said,

ADVISOR: [01:15:49] But you just have to think of what if something happened to you, how much of it does Jennifer need? Yeah. So sorry. It’s really important. Yeah. Well, but sometimes when I, when I run annuities, I’ve got different options of that. But let’s say how much? 100 %. Yes.

CLIENT1: [01:16:05] So this was taken into account. I took the full after‑tax portion withdrawal.

ADVISOR: [01:16:10] Yeah. Of course.

CLIENT1: [01:16:11] 50, 60 grand, whatever it was.

ADVISOR: [01:16:13] And you put all this one as well in it.

CLIENT1: [01:16:15] Then.

ADVISOR: [01:16:17] What’s the total pot.

CLIENT1: [01:16:19] For for this annuity. 112,000.

ADVISOR: [01:16:23] Oh so no it’s not including this one.

CLIENT1: [01:16:25] So it’s actually maybe.

CLIENT1: [01:16:27] This one was 6781.

ADVISOR: [01:16:31] When did you run it? December?

ADVISOR: [01:16:37] July last year. July 24.

ADVISOR: [01:16:40] Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Be really honest with you, and I will run you the numbers. That’s not the numbers we will get today.

CLIENT1: [01:16:47] That was four. I don’t know why that was. This one.

ADVISOR: [01:16:52] four grand per year? yeah. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:16:56] And this was 5441. 5441.

ADVISOR: [01:16:59] Yeah. I think that’s more the kind of things we are looking at was a guaranteed period is a 2% escalation and all of that. May I? I’m just going to have a look at that. So it’s usually everything is stated here. Yeah. Which one was.

CLIENT1: [01:17:16] Ones got CPI and one hasn’t.

ADVISOR: [01:17:19] Okay. CPI. So it’s linked to the inflation. Yes.

CLIENT1: [01:17:22] Yeah. And this one isn’t I think. No. This one’s got no CPI.

ADVISOR: [01:17:27] Okay. So it’s not in line with CPI as you said.

CLIENT1: [01:17:31] Yeah. And this one has got CPI as well.

ADVISOR: [01:17:34] No guaranteed period, 100%.

CLIENT1: [01:17:38] Yeah. So you correct me if I’m. If I’m not doing this correctly,

ADVISOR: [01:17:45] Tell me.

CLIENT1: [01:17:46] If I was to choose myself without any advice, I would say 50% to Jennifer if I died, no CPI and and take it back for now.

ADVISOR: [01:17:59] Why no CPI?

CLIENT1: [01:18:02] I just go, well, I’d either adjust.

ADVISOR: [01:18:06] expense? Is going to go up.

CLIENT1: [01:18:09] Yeah, I’d adjust my lifestyle to suit, which is going to happen anyway as I get older, isn’t it? Or.

ADVISOR: [01:18:19] But this is. Yeah, this is to regulate, I get it. It’s just inflation is is is there. But okay.

CLIENT1: [01:18:25] Yeah, it’s I’m just saying I’m not saying that that’s what I’ll finally do. I’m just saying if I didn’t have an advisor and and I had to make those decisions. That’s what I would probably go for. Okay. Because what? The target is 2%, isn’t it?

ADVISOR: [01:18:43] Inflation.

ADVISOR: [01:18:43] Inflation? Yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:18:44] The target. Yeah. No, that doesn’t happen. Yeah. It was 11% two years ago, but.

ADVISOR: [01:18:49] It didn’t stay there for the like. It wouldn’t stay there for all the all your life. So I agree. But for example most of the time I do 3% escalation personally. And because.

CLIENT1: [01:19:01] It’s 2%.

ADVISOR: [01:19:02] 2%.

CLIENT1: [01:19:03] Yeah. What is 2%.

ADVISOR: [01:19:05] Because 2% is more more or less the U.S. target. It’s nothing linked to annuities usually annuities. It’s usually you do CPI 3% or 5%. Yeah. Usually people do put inflation escalation into their annuities because really. Yeah. Monthly in advance. And I saw no guarantee period. So you don’t like more or less you don’t want if something happens to you, you don’t want this, policy to pay for five years at least.

CLIENT1: [01:19:40] So, sorry?

ADVISOR: [01:19:41] I repeat, don’t worry, there is an option when you do annuities. And I saw that there was not it was not selected on one of the quotes. It’s called a guarantee period. Where.

CLIENT1: [01:19:50] No, I don’t think so. Okay. You might tell me when you do your review.

ADVISOR: [01:19:56] The guarantee doesn’t shock me. It’s fine. The escalation. Yes, a bit more.

CLIENT1: [01:20:02] Because I’m just like looking now. So two at 2%. I know it’s not always going to be 2%, but 2% on 12 K is $240. Yeah. That make a massive difference to my a year. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:20:15] But every year it goes up.

CLIENT1: [01:20:16] Yeah I know but.

ADVISOR: [01:20:18] It does.

CLIENT1: [01:20:19] It does.

CLIENT2: [01:20:19] It does make a difference.

ADVISOR: [01:20:21] No it does make a difference. Can you have it. You must see it when you go grocery shopping. Everything is so much more expensive. I personally see it by basket for the same thing. Bag has gone $50 more than it And it used to be, oh, I do think your escalation is a good part of that, but it’s okay. We can run numbers. I do think some people underestimate how much things goes up every year.

CLIENT1: [01:20:44] Yeah. Okay.

ADVISOR: [01:20:45] But it just it just

CLIENT1: [01:20:48] But I was going to say as well, so say I say 50% for Jennifer. Yeah. If. What would be the difference to me or to us now.

ADVISOR: [01:21:02] If she was 100% or 75%. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:21:04] Happy to show you.

CLIENT1: [01:21:05] If that means.

ADVISOR: [01:21:08] Yeah. Agree.

CLIENT1: [01:21:08] If it means a small amount now.

CLIENT1: [01:21:12] But. We also want to live for now, if that makes sense.

ADVISOR: [01:21:18] Completely.

CLIENT1: [01:21:19] And with I don’t know whether I said to you expenses were for household expenses. That’s not taking into account vacations and things. I said about eight grand a year.

ADVISOR: [01:21:33] Yes.

CLIENT1: [01:21:35] You said that seemed quite low, but it’s good.

ADVISOR: [01:21:38] I mean, it’s great as far as it’s the right number. It’s perfect. Yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:21:42] Because I’ve got a, like, I’ve got a spreadsheet filled with all my things on, like property taxes, cable bill, house insurance, gas, electric, water, all those things. And that’s the . okay, that’s the annual figure.

ADVISOR: [01:21:58] Yeah. Okay. Perfect. I mean, good. So, but so, again, the only thing I want to really quickly, quickly chat about is what you need. But you would like 12 K in addition to your Social Security benefit, right? Because you, you you don’t seem to take Social Security benefit into consideration much. Well, I mean, it’s coming your way.

CLIENT1: [01:22:26] When it comes. Yeah. July 27. I would like my Social Security benefit approximately 12 K. Yeah. My private income personally, not Jennifer’s, just mine. 12 K. Yeah. Okay. And Jennifer, to have a personal Social Security benefit income . 12 K. Super. Okay. So if you like then combined, it’s 36. Yes.

ADVISOR: [01:22:54] Okay. Gotcha.

CLIENT1: [01:22:54] That’s my target.

ADVISOR: [01:22:56] So how do you . yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:22:57] As as near as possible. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:22:59] So how do you feel with those numbers that you got from an annuity compared to what actually is your target already?

CLIENT1: [01:23:06] Not good. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:23:10] Okay. No, I, I want to be clear about this. Yeah. Do we either realize that either your target is going to be maybe hard to achieve with having a secure income? Or do we realize that we might be able to have it with systematic withdrawals, but maybe we have to still lower it a little compared to the pot size. It’s just food for thought for them to have to answer, but.

CLIENT1: [01:23:38] Well.

ADVISOR: [01:23:39] 12 K per year, let’s say, without being really invested. That’s more or less ten years of your pot after tax‑free cash flow, right? So we have all those ideas, and we do need that money to be invested to work for you. Because otherwise in ten years or 13 or 14 years, you run out of money, if that’s what we’re going to take every year. Does that make sense? You could get it. But the idea is that might not last long enough for you to, all your life. So all those I give you a secure income. Lower systematic withdrawals might be giving you more flexible options to make money working, although you never know how the market can go. But just saying.

CLIENT1: [01:24:22] So initially, like I said, initially, I think the thing to do would be to not think about a fixed annuity until July 27, when I come to get my Social Security benefit, and then look at that then, but stay in systematic withdrawals from April 26 until July 27 and see how that . see how, see how it performs in systematic withdrawals and whether I’m taking too much out of it or whatever, and then see what we might get as an annuity then and then decide we stay where we are or move it to an annuity, then. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:25:03] But I just need to say something is if we imagine we do that, we put the money into a systematic withdrawal investment. And I’m sorry, I’m just challenging here. And so something happened with the market. And the pot go lower and you decide to buy an annuity and the annuity rates might be lower. Yeah. I’d be really annoying. I would be really sad. That would be really . So when I see those, if I ultimately the way I have to think is to put the money in cash. We can’t. You can’t put your money at risk for 18 months for you to think about. Then we put all the money in cash into a money‑market fund, which is . there is no risk. You start to draw a bit money, and then after those 18 months, you take a decision. Either we re‑invest it or either we actually buy an annuity, because 18 months is not long enough for money to work for you in your favor. So the market can’t make just 40 % in 18 months. A one‑year type of performance is 13 %. Maybe top top. And if it’s a good year, right? So if we take the risk of moving your retirement account into those investments with a systematic withdrawal plan, but then you decide to buy an annuity and part of the pot has gone down. Everything here would not make sense. Make sense again, because maybe the pot, instead of being 120, let’s just say it would be . I’m going to make it a bit too much, but I just want to make you realize it would be 95 K, then the investment.

ADVISOR: [01:26:50] have lost money. You should. You would have been okay with systematic withdrawals because part of it is is not invested really too hard. But that part has been. But because we want to buy an annuity we need to use everything. But that part has lost money. So how do we feel now that this part is only 95 K and we need to buy an annuity? And also we never sure what the annuity rates. But it’s more about when we take a decision with if you are unsure about what you want to do for 18 months, there is no even point of really investing the money, it’s better to put it into a safe one or two safe funds. Wait for those 18 months. You take a bit of money, and then after those 18 months, you take the decision of like, do I buy an annuity? Do I do really systematic withdrawals for the rest of my life or part of my life or part of the pot? Don’t have to put in anything. Don’t have to take a decision today. But do you understand how personally I would feel like if you were putting the money at work and 18 months later the pot has done 8 % or 9 % and you want to buy an annuity, you’d be like, oh, and I’m like, have I? There was a risk. Does that make sense? That’s that part.

CLIENT1: [01:27:59] Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:27:59] I understand your idea. I completely understand, but we will not invest it the same way if you are unsure about what you want to do 18 months after, which is okay.

CLIENT1: [01:28:10] I’m not saying 18 months after I definitely want to buy an annuity. I’m just saying we’ll review it again then and see and said what?

ADVISOR: [01:28:17] Yeah, yeah, I understand.

CLIENT1: [01:28:19] There is to buy based on what I’ve taken out already. Yeah. And say stay where we are or go for an annuity.

ADVISOR: [01:28:27] Then I completely understand you. I just want to explain that some investment might go down. They all look up. So you’re happy but they can go down. Yeah, yeah. So it’s really that part that is important. It’s when you start to go down there and you have to think, well it’s fine. I start to draw . down. But part of that money is going to be is really invested.

CLIENT1: [01:28:45] So because what I didn’t say was my, my initial thought was for, to achieve my, my 24,000 then. Yeah. For me personally. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:28:58] Yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:28:59] For the first 18 months I was planning on . in my head, I was planning on taking the after‑tax basis portion. Yeah. Taking 12,000 a year out of the IRA and taking 12,000 from my lump sum.

ADVISOR: [01:29:19] Yes. Okay.

CLIENT1: [01:29:20] That makes sense. Yes, it does make sense because from January to April 26 till July 27. Yeah.

ADVISOR: [01:29:29] No, it does make sense.

CLIENT1: [01:29:30] It’s 15 months now. Yeah. I’ve got to basically achieve $2,000 a month income. Yes, I’d like to. I don’t have to. I could just achieve the eight grand and sit here and vegetate. But I don’t want to do that.

ADVISOR: [01:29:44] No. And that’s the point. You’re going to spend more money in the next 15 years than you will do after. So it is the time to spend your money. But it just, I just want to again, it’s it’s just I want to understand. I like the idea. I understand what you want to do, but this is what you want to do and what really everything is possible, but the risk attached to each decision. I’m not saying once you do something, you are . well, no. Once you buy an annuity, you’re locked. You can’t do anything. But what I want to say is, if we decided to do systematic withdrawals first, we really need to have a think, and maybe I’d change a couple of points of the fact that you are thinking to buy an annuity two years after, even if it’s three, but it’s just that money is going to be at risk. You don’t have to decide now because it’s going to be some weeks, but it’s what I want you really to think about.

CLIENT1: [01:30:33] If I had to make the decision now, and it was that, those figures in there, I wouldn’t take an annuity.

ADVISOR: [01:30:39] Okay. Okay, cool.

CLIENT1: [01:30:42] No, because.

ADVISOR: [01:30:43] Well, it’s far from your target.

CLIENT1: [01:30:45] Say the best one there was six. Yeah. And that one was two. Yeah. That’s eight. That’s still, to me, that’s four grand to what I really want and two grand short of what I probably could live with.

ADVISOR: [01:30:59] Okay. But then you have . then I need to show you how systematic withdrawals look like. Yeah. And how long it will last. Yeah. Gotcha.

CLIENT1: [01:31:09] How I can get as close to that figure as possible. Yes. And then if I run out of money, then I’m 85. If I live that long.

ADVISOR: [01:31:20] I see what you mean.

CLIENT1: [01:31:21] Somebody can look after me.

ADVISOR: [01:31:25] No, I see what you mean. Okay.

CLIENT1: [01:31:26] Because if I got to 85 and I ran out of money other than my Social Security benefit.

ADVISOR: [01:31:35] So more or less is because you know that you want to enjoy the next 15, 20 years, that you want the income, but you are aware that you might run out of money.

CLIENT1: [01:31:44] If I got to 86 and I ran out of money. Yes. And I had my . I still have my 12,000 whatever Social Security benefit. And I could pay my bills on 10,000. I’d be happy. Yeah. Yeah. Because my, my mom is, funny enough, she was 88 the other day. Yeah. And she’s now on her own. And her husband died. She gets a . gets a little bit of his, of his pension or whatever. But not saying we want to do what she does, but she does zero. She doesn’t do anything. But it’s 88.

ADVISOR: [01:32:20] She’s . she’s 88, but she’s.

CLIENT2: [01:32:22] Never done anything.

ADVISOR: [01:32:23] That is different.

CLIENT1: [01:32:24] Well, not for the last ten years since her husband died, but she’s got her Social Security benefit and a little bit of other income, and she couldn’t spend it.

ADVISOR: [01:32:32] Yeah. No, no, I’ve got a 83 and 84‑year‑old clients, and they put a lot of money in their house. They have a historic‑register building, but they were really honest. They can’t. she’s got a hip replacement. She had hip replacement this summer. They really show me how much they have had to change from one age to another one. So I do agree that the next 15 – 20 years is where you should enjoy. I mean, you are, more or less, you are like my parents’ age. They are slightly older than you and they haven’t even . my dad hasn’t even retired yet, but he’s going to do it next year, and all they want is to travel and move. And I’m like, please do, because it’s . is now. Once mobility change. My grandmas are 89 and 93, and although they are still, like, really active, either they stay in town or otherwise someone takes them somewhere or they go to coastal Maine. But life is a lot more simple. The money they spend is usually on their grandchildren, really. So I agree with that. Now I get it a bit more, but I just want to . I like this. It’s good because I have just changed you and you gave me more information.

CLIENT1: [01:33:34] And if the worse comes to worse, we could sell this.

CLIENT2: [01:33:36] And we bought a big house here. Yes. It’s, it’s not.

CLIENT1: [01:33:39] We’ve got three bedrooms. We only use one.

ADVISOR: [01:33:41] Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that’s true, it’s true. Downsizing is always, if I’m honest, an option.

CLIENT1: [01:33:48] It’s an option.

ADVISOR: [01:33:48] But also sometimes, you know, you’ve got stairs. It’s not practical. You never know. An apartment at some point might be easier to just take care of and just leave it. But yeah.

CLIENT1: [01:33:56] Cool. We often thought that because this is quite big down here, if we had to, we could move or get rid of all this and put a double bed in here by the radiator. Yeah. And there that and we just sit here happy.

ADVISOR: [01:34:10] When is that, not in your dreams? Yeah. We get an apartment.

ADVISOR: [01:34:18] Okay. Sounds good. Okay, so we do like this, so don’t be surprised if you don’t hear from me for two weeks at least. I need to wait for them to come back to me. Once I have good stuff out of the information I know it’s coming up, I’ll just email you when we book another time for me to come back with all my information, cash flow. And then we see some quotes just so you get an update of what’s out there, and then you keep thinking of this. I send you videos, and I think you’re probably going to take a decision on this next time, and then the rest is all about how it’s invested and how it’s doing. Really? Okay. Good. You think? Yeah.

CLIENT2: [01:34:57] Any questions?

ADVISOR: [01:34:57] Any questions?

CLIENT1: [01:34:59] No, I don’t think so.

ADVISOR: [01:35:00] Well, I don’t have questions either.

CLIENT1: [01:35:03] Okay.

ADVISOR: [01:35:03] Well, it’s been lovely meeting you.
